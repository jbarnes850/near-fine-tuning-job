It illustrates a few key concepts about NEAR's SDK, particularly around the use of generics within smart contracts. Let’s break down the code step by step:\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n```rust\n//! Functions can't use generics.\n```\nThis comment indicates a known limitation or design choice within the NEAR SDK: functions in smart contracts cannot use generics. This means that while you can define generic types in your function signatures, they cannot be effectively used in the context of NEAR smart contracts due to the way contracts are compiled and executed on the blockchain.\n\n```rust\nuse near_sdk::near;\n```\nThis line imports the `near` macro from the NEAR SDK. This macro is used to annotate functions or structures that are part of the NEAR smart contract’s interface. It helps the SDK understand which parts of the code are meant to interact with the NEAR blockchain.\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Default)]\n#[near(contract_state)]\nstruct Ident {\n    value: u32,\n}\n```\nHere, we define a structure named `Ident`. The `#[derive(Default)]` attribute automatically implements the `Default` trait for `Ident`, allowing you to create an instance of `Ident` with default values (in this case, `value` will be initialized to `0` since it's a `u32`).\n\nThe `#[near(contract_state)]` attribute indicates that this struct holds state that will be stored on the NEAR blockchain. This means instances of `Ident` can be serialized and stored in the contract’s storage.\n\n```rust\n#[near]\nimpl Ident {\n    pub fn is_ident<T>(&self, val: T) -> T {\n        val\n    }\n}\n```\nThis block defines an implementation of methods for the `Ident` struct. The `#[near]` macro here indicates that this implementation contains functions that are exposed to the NEAR runtime.\n\n- The method `is_ident<T>(&self, val: T) -> T` is defined here, which takes a value of type `T` and returns it. \n- However, the comment at the top indicates that functions like `is_ident` with generics cannot be used in practice due to constraints on smart contracts, meaning that if you were to compile and deploy this, you might encounter issues due to generics not being supported in the context of NEAR.\n\n### Main Function\n\n```rust\nfn main() {}\n```\nThe `main` function is defined but does not contain any logic. In a typical Rust application, the `main` function is the entry point. However, in the context of NEAR smart contracts, the contract is typically deployed and interacted with on the blockchain rather than executed through a traditional Rust binary.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, this code snippet defines a simple NEAR smart contract structure with a method that demonstrates an attempt to use generics. The main takeaway is that while Rust supports generics, the NEAR SDK has limitations that prevent the effective use of generic functions within its smart contract environment. This serves as a reminder to developers to design their contracts with these constraints in mind."}]}

Let's break down the components of the code to understand its functionality and purpose.\n\n### Breakdown of the Code\n\n1. **Imports**:\n    ```javascript\n    import { createContext } from 'react';\n    ```\n    - This line imports the `createContext` function from the React library. This function is used to create a new Context object, which allows for easier state management across different components in a React application.\n\n2. **Type Definition**:\n    ```javascript\n    /**\n     * @typedef NearContext\n     * @property {import('./wallets/near').Wallet} wallet Current wallet\n     * @property {string} signedAccountId The AccountId of the signed user\n     */\n    ```\n    - This JSDoc comment defines a new type `NearContext`. It describes the structure of the context object that will be used in the application.\n    - It has two properties:\n        - `wallet`: This is expected to be of type `Wallet`, which is imported from a local module `./wallets/near`. This represents the current wallet being used in the application.\n        - `signedAccountId`: This is a string that holds the Account ID of the user who is currently signed in.\n\n3. **Creating the Context**:\n    ```javascript\n    /** @type {import ('react').Context<NearContext>} */\n    export const NearContext = createContext({\n      wallet: undefined,\n      signedAccountId: ''\n    });\n    ```\n    - This line creates a new context called `NearContext` using the `createContext` function. \n    - The context is initialized with a default value:\n        - `wallet`: set to `undefined`, indicating that no wallet is initially connected.\n        - `signedAccountId`: set to an empty string, indicating that no user is signed in by default.\n    - The JSDoc comment above indicates that `NearContext` is of type `Context<NearContext>`, meaning that it will conform to the structure defined previously.\n\n### Purpose of This Code\n\n- **State Management**: The `NearContext` will allow React components to access the current wallet and signed account information without having to pass props through every level of the component tree. This is particularly useful in a decentralized application (dApp) where user authentication and wallet management are central features.\n  \n- **Ease of Use**: By creating a context, the developers can provide a way for components to subscribe to context changes. For example, when a user connects or disconnects their wallet, components that consume this context can automatically re-render with the updated wallet information.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nIn a component, you could use this context like so:\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useContext } from 'react';\nimport { NearContext } from './context';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const { wallet, signedAccountId } = useContext(NearContext);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>User Account</h1>\n      <p>Wallet: {wallet ? wallet.address : 'No wallet connected'}</p>\n      <p>Signed Account ID: {signedAccountId || 'Not signed in'}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis code snippet sets up a context for managing user wallet and account information in a React-based NEAR application. It simplifies the process of accessing and updating this information across various components within the application, thus enhancing code maintainability and user experience."}]}

Let's break it down for clarity:\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n1. **Serialized Data Structure**:\n   The output displayed in the `<details>` section shows a serialized representation of the smart contract's state. The data is represented as an array of key-value pairs:\n\n   ```bash\n   [\n     {\n       key: 'STATE',\n       value: '\\x03\\x00\\x00\\x00bye\\x02\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x06\\x00\\x00\\x00prefix'\n     },\n     { key: 'prefix\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00', value: '\\x00' },\n     { key: 'prefix\\x01\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00', value: '\\x01' }\n   ]\n   ```\n\n   - **Key `STATE`**: This key holds the serialized representation of the contract's main state. The value includes binary data, where:\n     - `\\x03` indicates the length of the string that follows (in this case, `bye`).\n     - The string `bye` is followed by additional binary values that likely represent metadata or configuration related to the contract state.\n   \n   - **Keys `prefix\\x00...` and `prefix\\x01...`**: These are additional entries that store values related to a vector. The `prefix` indicates a type of entry in the state, and the trailing `\\00` and `\\01` suggest that they represent different elements in a vector (here, the vector contains values `0` and `1`).\n\n2. **Changes in State**:\n   The text indicates that modifying the state (e.g., adding a new string `bye`) results in updating the `STATE` key. The vector, which holds multiple values, now has two elements, reflecting the new state of the contract.\n\n3. **Deserialization Error**:\n   When a smart contract method is invoked, the contract must deserialize its state. This involves reading the `STATE` key and converting it back into an object that matches the contract's expected structure (in this case, `Contract{string: String, vector: Vector<u8>}`).\n\n   If the contract's structure doesn't match the serialized data (for example, if the contract was upgraded and the new code expects a different structure), it will fail to deserialize, resulting in a panic with the message `Cannot deserialize the contract state`.\n\n### Solutions for Deserialization Issues\n\nTo handle deserialization errors when the contract's structure has changed, the document suggests two possible approaches:\n\n1. **Rollback**: Reverting to a previous version of the contract code that matches the serialized state. This is a straightforward solution but may not always be feasible.\n\n2. **State Migration**: Implementing a method to migrate the contract's state to fit the new structure. This involves writing code to read the existing serialized state, transform it into the new format, and save it back. This approach is more complex but allows for continuity and the addition of new features.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis snippet illustrates important aspects of state management in NEAR smart contracts, specifically how contract state is serialized and deserialized. It emphasizes the need for careful handling of state transitions, especially when deploying new versions of contracts. Understanding these principles is crucial for developers working within the NEAR ecosystem to ensure robust and error-free smart contracts."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain the following code snippet from NEAR repository file `neps/nep-0508.md`:\n```, in the last block of the epoch, the EpochConfig for epoch T+2 will be set. The EpochConfig for epoch T+2 will have the new shard layout.\n* In epoch T + 1, all nodes will perform the state split. The child shards will be kept up to date with the blockchain up until the epoch end first via catchup, and later as part of block postprocessing state application.\n* In epoch T + 2, the chain will switch to the new shard layout. \n\n## Reference Implementation\n\nThe implementation heavily re-uses the implementation from [NEP-40](https://github.com/near/NEPs/blob/master/specs/Proposals/0040-split-states.md). Below are listed the major differences and additions. \n\n### Code pointers to the proposed implementation \n\n* [new shard layout](https://github.com/near/nearcore/blob/c9836ab5b05c229da933d451fe8198d781f40509/core/primitives/src/shard_layout.rs#L161)  \n* [the main logic for splitting states](https://github.com/near/nearcore/blob/c9836ab5b05c229da933d451fe8198d781f40509/chain/chain/src/resharding.rs#L280)\n* [the main logic for applying chunks to split states](https://github.com/near/nearcore/blob/c9836ab5b05c229da933d451fe8198d781f40509/chain/chain/src/update_shard.rs#L315)\n* [the main logic for garbage collecting state from parent shard](https://github.com/near/nearcore/blob/c9836ab5b05c229da933d451fe8198d781f40509/chain/chain/src/store.rs#L2335)\n\n### Flat Storage\n\nThe old implementation of resharding relied on iterating over the full trie state of the parent shard in order to build the state for the children shards. This implementation was suitable at the time but since then the state has grown considerably and this implementation is now too slow to fit within a single epoch. The new implementation relies on iterating through the flat storage in order to build the children shards quicker. Based on benchmarks, splitting the largest shard by using flat storage can take around 15 min without throttling and around 3 hours with throttling to maintain the block production rate.\n\nThe new implementation will also propagate the flat storage for the children shards and keep it up to date with the chain until the switch to the new shard layout in the next epoch. The old implementation didn't handle this case because the flat storage didn't exist back then.\n\nIn order to ensure consistent view of the flat storage while splitting the state the node will maintain a snapshot of the flat state and related columns as of the last block of the epoch prior to resharding. The existing implementation of flat state snapshots used in State Sync will be used for this purpose.\n\n### Handling receipts, gas burnt and balance burnt\n\nWhen resharding, extra care should be taken when handling receipts in order to ensure that no receipts are lost or duplicated. The gas burnt and balance burnt also need to be correctly handled. The old resharding implementation for handling receipts, gas burnt and balance burnt relied on the fact in the first resharding there was only a single parent shard to begin with. The new implementation will provide a more generic and robust way of reassigning the receipts to the child shards, gas burnt, and balance burnt, that works for arbitrary splitting of shards, regardless of the previous shard layout. \n\n### New shard layout\n\nThe first release of the resharding v2 will contain a new shard layout where one of the existing shards will be split into two smaller shards. Furthermore additional reshardings can be scheduled in subsequent releases without additional NEPs unless the need for it arises. A new shard layout can be determined and will be scheduled and executed with the next protocol upgrade. Resharding will typically happen by splitting one of the existing shards into two smaller shards. The new shard layout will be created by adding a new boundary account that will be determined by analysing the storage and gas usage metrics within the shard and selecting a point that will divide the shard roughly in half in accordance to the mentioned metrics. Other metrics can also be used based on requirements.\n\n### Removal of Fixed shards\n\nFixed shards was a feature of the protocol that allowed for assigning specific accounts and all of their recursive sub accounts to a predetermined shard. This feature was only used for testing and was never used in production. Fixed shards feature unfortunately breaks the contiguity of shards and is not compatible with the new resharding flow. A sub account of a fixed shard account can fall in the middle of account range that belongs to a different shard. This property of fixed shards made it particularly hard to reason about and implement efficient resharding```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This code snippet from NEP-0508 outlines the proposed changes and implementation strategies related to resharding in the NEAR Protocol. Below is a detailed explanation of the key components mentioned in the snippet:\n\n### Overview of Epochs and Shard Layout Changes\n1. **Epoch Transition**: In the NEAR Protocol, time is divided into epochs. The snippet discusses the transition from epoch T to epoch T+2, where the `EpochConfig` for T+2 is defined, and it includes a new shard layout.\n   \n2. **State Split**: During epoch T+1, all nodes perform a state split. This involves splitting the existing state of the blockchain into smaller child shards. The child shards will remain synchronized with the main blockchain until the end of the epoch.\n\n3. **Shard Layout Switch**: At the start of epoch T+2, the blockchain will switch to the new shard layout, which is crucial for improving scalability and performance.\n\n### Reference Implementation\nThe implementation of this proposal builds upon NEP-40, which also deals with state splitting. The following are highlighted as key components of the implementation:\n\n- **New Shard Layout**: The shard layout is defined in the specified code link, which details how shards are organized in the NEAR Protocol.\n\n- **Main Logic for Splitting States**: This part of the code manages how the state is split into child shards. It is essential for efficiently dividing the blockchain's state across multiple shards.\n\n- **Applying Chunks to Split States**: This refers to the logic that applies the state changes to the child shards as they are created.\n\n- **Garbage Collection**: The code handles the cleanup of state from the parent shard that is no longer needed after splitting.\n\n### Flat Storage Implementation\nThe snippet describes a shift from an older approach to a more efficient one using flat storage:\n\n- **Flat Storage vs. Trie State**: The previous implementation used a trie structure to manage state, which became inefficient with the growth of the state. The new flat storage approach allows for faster state access and manipulation, significantly reducing the time required for resharding.\n\n- **Snapshotting**: To ensure a consistent view of the state during the split, the nodes will maintain a snapshot of the flat state as of the last block of the prior epoch. This allows for a reliable and consistent state during the resharding process.\n\n### Handling Receipts, Gas Burnt, and Balance Burnt\nResharding introduces complexities in managing receipts and gas/balance accounting:\n\n- **Receipt Management**: The code highlights the importance of tracking receipts to avoid loss or duplication during the transition to child shards. A more generic approach to reassignment of receipts is proposed to handle arbitrary splits.\n\n- **Gas and Balance Accounting**: Similar to receipts, gas burnt and balance burnt must be correctly accounted for during resharding to ensure that state transitions remain accurate.\n\n### New Shard Layout and Future Resharding\nThe proposal outlines a new shard layout:\n\n- **Splitting Shards**: The first phase involves splitting an existing shard into two smaller ones based on metrics like storage and gas usage, which helps in more evenly distributing workloads across shards.\n\n- **Flexible Future Resharding**: The design anticipates that additional resharding can occur in subsequent protocol upgrades without necessitating new NEPs unless required, indicating a more adaptable blockchain architecture.\n\n### Removal of Fixed Shards\nThe snippet concludes with the removal of fixed shards:\n\n- **Fixed Shards Limitations**: Fixed shards were used for testing but proved to be problematic for efficient resharding. The proposal emphasizes that fixed shards disrupt the contiguity of accounts, complicating the resharding process.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, NEP-0508 proposes a systematic approach to improve the shard management in the NEAR Protocol, focusing on efficiency, scalability, and reliable state transitions. The use of flat storage, careful handling of receipts and gas accounting, and the removal of outdated features like fixed shards are central to this proposal's vision for a more robust blockchain architecture."}]}

Below is a detailed breakdown of the code along with explanations of key components.\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n```rust\nconst STATUS_MSG_WASM_FILEPATH: &str = \"./examples/res/status_message.wasm\";\n```\n- This line defines a constant string that holds the relative file path to the WebAssembly (WASM) file of the smart contract named `status_message.wasm`. This file contains the compiled code of the smart contract that will be deployed.\n\n```rust\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {\n```\n- The `#[tokio::main]` attribute macro indicates that this is the entry point of an asynchronous program using the Tokio runtime. The `main` function returns a `Result` type which can encapsulate any errors using the `anyhow` crate.\n\n```rust\n    let worker = near_workspaces::sandbox().await?;\n```\n- Here, a new sandbox worker is created using the `near_workspaces` crate, which allows for testing and interacting with NEAR in a local environment. The `await?` syntax is used for error handling, propagating any errors that might occur.\n\n```rust\n    let wasm = std::fs::read(STATUS_MSG_WASM_FILEPATH)?;\n```\n- This line reads the contents of the specified WASM file into a byte array, which will be used to deploy the smart contract. Again, `?` is used to handle any potential errors in reading the file.\n\n```rust\n    let contract = worker.dev_deploy(&wasm).await?;\n```\n- The `dev_deploy` method is called on the worker, passing in the WASM byte array. This deploys the smart contract to the local NEAR sandbox environment. The result is stored in the `contract` variable.\n\n```rust\n    let outcome = contract\n        .call(\"set_status\")\n        .args_json(serde_json::json!({\n            \"message\": \"hello_world\",\n        }))\n        .transact()\n        .await?;\n```\n- This block makes a call to the smart contract's `set_status` method, passing it a JSON argument containing a message (\"hello_world\"). The `transact()` method sends the transaction to the blockchain. The outcome of this transaction is captured in the `outcome` variable.\n\n```rust\n    let block_reference = {\n        let hash = outcome.outcome().block_hash;\n        near_primitives::types::BlockReference::BlockId(near_primitives::types::BlockId::Hash(\n            near_primitives::hash::CryptoHash(hash.0),\n        ))\n    };\n```\n- A block reference is created using the block hash from the outcome of the previous transaction. This block reference will be used to fetch the protocol configuration associated with that block.\n\n```rust\n    // NOTE: this API is under the \"experimental\" flag and no guarantees are given.\n    let protocol_config = worker.protocol_config(block_reference).await?;\n```\n- The `protocol_config` method retrieves the configuration of the NEAR Protocol at the specified block reference. A note indicates that this API is experimental, meaning it might change without warning.\n\n### Example Output\nThe comments show an example output of the `protocol_config`, which includes various details about the NEAR Protocol's state such as:\n- `protocol_version`: The current version of the protocol.\n- `genesis_time`: The time when the blockchain was created.\n- `chain_id`: The identifier of the blockchain.\n- Various configuration parameters like gas limits, fee structures, and thresholds for block producers.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis code snippet effectively demonstrates the process of deploying a smart contract and querying the protocol configuration on the NEAR blockchain. It utilizes asynchronous Rust programming with error handling and shows how to interact with smart contracts using the `near-workspaces` library. Developers can use this pattern as a starting point for building and testing their own NEAR-based applications."}]}

This document describes the transition plan for each of the services, activities, and tools that Pagoda develops or operates.\n\n<!-- truncate -->\n\n### Critical NEAR Services\n\nThe critical services below will continue to be operated and maintained by Pagoda until they are smoothly transitioned to new operators in the NEAR ecosystem during the second half of 2024:\n\n-   [near.org RPC](https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/providers)\n-   [NEAR Lake](https://docs.near.org/concepts/advanced/near-lake-framework)\n-   [BigQuery Public Dataset](https://docs.near.org/build/data-infrastructure/big-query)\n-   [Node Snapshots](https://near-nodes.io/intro/node-data-snapshots)\n-   [State Sync](https://near-nodes.io/rpc/state-sync)\n-   Undocumented but critical services:\n    -   KitWallet Indexer API\n    -   near-cli Testnet Faucet\n\nEach transition will be independently planned and communicated on its own timeline and this page will be updated accordingly.\n\nThe NEAR [Infrastructure Committee](https://dev.near.org/infrastructure-committee.near/widget/near-prpsls-bos.components.pages.app?page=about) will manage this transition process by soliciting proposals from the community for continued operation of these services, then will select, fund, and oversee the new operator.\n\n#### A Note About near.org RPC\n\nThe Infrastructure Committee feels that Pagoda's fully-subsidized near.org RPC service is getting in the way of decentralization efforts and is preventing high-quality commercial RPC offerings from gaining traction. If a NEAR core team continues to support a free-to-use near.org RPC service, it will be required to gradually lower its rate limits over the coming months to prevent abuse. More details on this plan will be communicated by the end of September 2024. In light of this proposed change, **high-traffic near.org RPC users should start making plans to switch to other RPC providers**.\n\n### Chain Abstraction Services\n\n[Chain Signatures](https://docs.near.org/concepts/abstraction/chain-signatures), Multichain Gas Relayer, and [FastAuth](https://docs.near.org/build/chain-abstraction/fastauth-sdk) will continue to be developed by Pagoda, then will be taken over by the new Chain Abstraction / Multichain spinout from Pagoda and Proximity. More information will be shared in September or October 2024.\n\n### Pagoda Operations & Ecosystem Services\n\nPagoda’s ecosystem services will transition as follows:\n\n-   [Infrastructure Committee](https://dev.near.org/infrastructure-committee.near/widget/near-prpsls-bos.components.pages.app?page=about) administration, the recently rebooted Security Assessment Program, and management of the [near.org](http://near.org) website will move under the purview of NEAR Foundation.\n-   [Bug bounty](https://hackenproof.com/company/near/programs) triage will be transitioned to the protocol team at NEAR One.\n-   The [NEAR Helpdesk](https://help.near.org/) will be turned into self-service documentation.\n-   Pagoda's informal technical / smart contract advisory services for other ecosystem companies will wind down over the next few months.\n\n### Open-Source Libraries\n\nThese open-source libraries and tools will be developed by Pagoda until they reach a logical completion or stopping point:\n\n-   [Pagoda Metatransaction Relayer](https://github.com/near/pagoda-relayer-rs)\n-   [Chain Hosted UI](https://github.com/near/chain-hosted-ui)\n-   [Modularization and Refactor](https://t.me/neardev/53280) of near-api-js\n\nOnce active development by Pagoda has ceased, it doesn't mean these tools have to languish. We encourage the NEAR community to continue this work. If you need funding to do so, you can submit proposals to [DevHub](https://dev.near.org/devhub.near/widget/app) or the [Infrastructure Committee](https://dev.near.org/infrastructure-committee.near/widget/near-prpsls-bos.components.pages.app?page=about).\n\n### Deprecated Services\n\nBetween now and February 2025, Pagoda's development work will slow down or stop on the following products and services:\n\n-   [QueryAPI](https://docs.near.org/build/data-infrastructure/query-api/intro)\n-```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The code snippet you've shared is a Markdown document that outlines the transition plan for Pagoda services within the NEAR ecosystem.

This is part of the NEAR smart contract standards for fungible tokens. Let's break down the code and its components for clarity.\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n```rust\nuse near_sdk::json_types::U128;\nuse near_sdk::{ext_contract, AccountId, PromiseOrValue};\n```\n\n- **Imports**: \n  - `U128`: A type for representing 128-bit unsigned integers. This is commonly used for amounts in fungible token transfers.\n  - `ext_contract`: A macro used to define an external contract interface, allowing contracts to interact with one another.\n  - `AccountId`: A type representing account identifiers on the NEAR blockchain.\n  - `PromiseOrValue`: A type that allows returning either a promise or a direct value. This is useful for handling asynchronous operations.\n\n```rust\n#[ext_contract(ext_ft_receiver)]\npub trait FungibleTokenReceiver {\n```\n\n- **`ext_contract` Macro**: This attribute indicates that the `FungibleTokenReceiver` trait will be used as an external contract interface. It allows other contracts to call the methods defined within it.\n- **`FungibleTokenReceiver` Trait**: This trait defines the expected behavior of a contract that will receive fungible tokens. Implementing this trait means that the contract can handle incoming token transfers.\n\n```rust\n    /// Called by fungible token contract after `ft_transfer_call` was initiated by\n    /// `sender_id` of the given `amount` with the transfer message given in `msg` field.\n    /// The `amount` of tokens were already transferred to this contract account and ready to be used.\n```\n\n- **Documentation Comment**: The comment explains the context in which the method is called. The `ft_on_transfer` method is invoked after a `ft_transfer_call` operation, which is a common pattern in NEAR for transferring tokens along with a message.\n\n```rust\n    /// The method must return the amount of tokens that are *not* used/accepted by this contract from the transferred\n    /// amount. Examples:\n    /// - The transferred amount was `500`, the contract completely takes it and must return `0`.\n    /// - The transferred amount was `500`, but this transfer call only needs `450` for the action passed in the `msg`\n    ///   field, then the method must return `50`.\n    /// - The transferred amount was `500`, but the action in `msg` field has expired and the transfer must be\n    ///   cancelled. The method must return `500` or panic.\n```\n\n- **Return Value Explanation**: This section outlines the expected return value of the method. It clarifies that the method should indicate how many tokens are not used or accepted by the contract. The examples illustrate different scenarios regarding the handling of the transferred amount.\n\n```rust\n    /// Arguments:\n    /// - `sender_id` - the account ID that initiated the transfer.\n    /// - `amount` - the amount of tokens that were transferred to this account in a decimal string representation.\n    /// - `msg` - a string message that was passed with this transfer call.\n```\n\n- **Parameter Documentation**: This part describes the parameters of the `ft_on_transfer` method:\n  - `sender_id`: The account that sent the tokens.\n  - `amount`: The total amount of tokens transferred, provided as a `U128`.\n  - `msg`: A string containing additional information that the sender included with the transfer.\n\n```rust\n    /// Returns the amount of unused tokens that should be returned to sender, in a decimal string representation.\n    fn ft_on_transfer(\n        &mut self,\n        sender_id: AccountId,\n        amount: U128,\n        msg: String,\n    ) -> PromiseOrValue<U128>;\n}\n```\n\n- **Method Signature**: \n  - `ft_on_transfer`: This method is defined within the `FungibleTokenReceiver` trait. \n  - The method takes a mutable reference to `self`, allowing the contract to modify its state.\n  - It accepts three parameters: `sender_id`, `amount`, and `msg`.\n  - It returns a `PromiseOrValue<U128>`, which indicates the amount of unused tokens. This return type allows for flexibility in handling asynchronous calls, where the contract may need to perform other operations before returning the unused tokens.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, this code snippet defines a trait for a fungible token receiver in NEAR Protocol. The `ft_on_transfer` method is a crucial part of the token transfer mechanism, allowing contracts to specify how many of the transferred tokens they accept and how many should be returned to the sender. The documentation within the code provides clear guidelines for implementing this method, ensuring that developers understand the expected behavior and return values."}]}

This contract allows users to set and retrieve status messages associated with their accounts. Below is a detailed breakdown of the code:\n\n### Importing Dependencies\n```javascript\nimport { Worker } from \"near-workspaces\";\nimport test from \"ava\";\n```\n- `Worker` from `near-workspaces` is used to create a simulated NEAR environment for testing.\n- `test` is imported from the `ava` library, which is a test runner for JavaScript.\n\n### Setup and Teardown Hooks\n```javascript\ntest.beforeEach(async (t) => {\n  // Init the worker and start a Sandbox server\n  const worker = await Worker.init();\n\n  // Prepare sandbox for tests, create accounts, deploy contracts, etc.\n  const root = worker.rootAccount;\n\n  // Deploy the status-message contract.\n  const statusMessage = await root.devDeploy(\n    \"./build/status-message-collections.wasm\"\n  );\n\n  // Test users\n  const ali = await root.createSubAccount(\"ali\");\n  const bob = await root.createSubAccount(\"bob\");\n  const carl = await root.createSubAccount(\"carl\");\n\n  // Save state for test runs\n  t.context.worker = worker;\n  t.context.accounts = { root, statusMessage, ali, bob, carl };\n});\n```\n- `test.beforeEach`: This hook runs before each test case. It initializes a NEAR worker environment and prepares the test setup.\n- A root account is created, and the `status-message-collections` smart contract is deployed.\n- Three sub-accounts (`ali`, `bob`, and `carl`) are created for testing purposes.\n- The worker and accounts are stored in `t.context` for access in the individual tests.\n\n```javascript\ntest.afterEach.always(async (t) => {\n  await t.context.worker.tearDown().catch((error) => {\n    console.log(\"Failed to tear down the worker:\", error);\n  });\n});\n```\n- `test.afterEach.always`: This hook runs after each test case to clean up the worker environment to prevent side effects between tests.\n\n### Test Cases\n#### Test 1: Root Gets Null Status\n```javascript\ntest(\"Root gets null status\", async (t) => {\n  const { root, statusMessage } = t.context.accounts;\n  const result = await statusMessage.view(\"get_status\", {\n    account_id: root.accountId,\n  });\n  t.is(result, null);\n});\n```\n- This test checks that the root account has no status message set initially, expecting a null response from the contract.\n\n#### Test 2: Ali Sets Then Gets Status\n```javascript\ntest(\"Ali sets then gets status\", async (t) => {\n  const { ali, statusMessage } = t.context.accounts;\n  await ali.call(statusMessage, \"set_status\", { message: \"hello\" });\n\n  t.is(\n    await statusMessage.view(\"get_status\", { account_id: ali.accountId }),\n    \"hello\"\n  );\n});\n```\n- This test ensures that when `ali` sets a status message (\"hello\"), it can subsequently retrieve that message correctly.\n\n#### Test 3: Bob and Carl Have Different Statuses\n```javascript\ntest(\"Bob and Carl have different statuses\", async (t) => {\n  const { statusMessage, bob, carl } = t.context.accounts;\n  await bob.call(statusMessage, \"set_status\", { message: \"hello\" });\n  await carl.call(statusMessage, \"set_status\", { message: \"world\" });\n\n  const bobStatus = await statusMessage.view(\"get_status\", {\n    account_id: bob.accountId,\n  });\n  const carlStatus = await statusMessage.view(\"get_status\", {\n    account_id: carl.accountId,\n  });\n  t.is(bobStatus, \"hello\");\n  t.is(carlStatus, \"world\");\n});\n```\n- This test verifies that `bob` and `carl` can set different status messages and retrieve them independently.\n\n#### Test 4: Get Statuses from the Contract\n```javascript\ntest(\"Get statuses from the contract\", async (t) => {\n  const { statusMessage, bob, carl } = t.context.accounts;\n  await bob.call(statusMessage, \"set_status\", { message: \"hello\" });\n  await carl.call(statusMessage, \"set_status\", { message: \"world\" });\n\n  const statuses = await statusMessage.view(\"get_all_statuses\", {});\n  t.deepEqual(statuses, [\n    [bob.accountId, \"hello\"],\n    [carl.accountId, \"world\"],\n  ]);\n});\n```\n- This test checks if the contract can return all statuses correctly, verifying the integrity of the stored data.\n\n#### Test 5: Message Has Stored by Someone\n```javascript\ntest(\"message has stored by someone\", async (t) => {\n  const { ali, statusMessage } = t.context.accounts;\n  await ali.call(statusMessage, \"set_status\", { message: \"hello\" });\n\n  t.is(await statusMessage.view(\"has_status\", { message: \"hello\" }), true);\n  t.is(await statusMessage.view(\"has_status\", { message: \"world\" }), false);\n});\n```\n- This test verifies that the contract can check if a specific message is stored by any user, confirming the existence of \"hello\" and the non-existence of \"world\".\n\n### Summary\nThis test suite is structured to ensure that the `status-message-collections` contract behaves as expected under various scenarios, including setting, retrieving, and checking the existence of status messages. Each test is isolated, and the use of hooks for setup and teardown ensures a clean environment for each test run. This approach is crucial for reliable testing in a blockchain context, where state can affect subsequent operations."}]}

It tests the signing and verification of messages, as well as the proper conversion of keys to and from string representations. Let's break down the key parts of the code:\n\n### Overview of the Code Snippet\n\n1. **Key Pair Generation and Signing**: The tests generate key pairs and use them to sign messages. The signatures are then verified to ensure they match the expected results.\n2. **Public Key Verification**: It confirms that the public key generated from the private key can verify the signature of a message.\n3. **Key Conversion**: It tests converting key pairs to and from string representations to ensure integrity in the conversion process.\n4. **Error Handling**: It checks that appropriate errors are thrown when invalid keys are provided.\n\n### Detailed Explanation of Each Test\n\n#### Test 1: Sign a Message and Verify Signature\n```typescript\nconst keyPair = KeyPairSecp256k1.fromRandom();\nconst message = new Uint8Array(sha256('message')); // Hash the message\nconst signature = keyPair.sign(message); // Sign the hashed message\nexpect(keyPair.verify(message, signature.signature)).toBeTruthy(); // Verify the signature\n```\n- **`KeyPairSecp256k1.fromRandom()`**: Generates a random key pair using the Secp256k1 curve.\n- **`sha256('message')`**: Computes the SHA-256 hash of the string 'message'.\n- **`keyPair.sign(message)`**: Signs the hashed message.\n- **`keyPair.verify(...)`**: Checks if the signature is valid for the given message.\n\n#### Test 2: Sign and Verify with a Specific Key\n```typescript\nconst keyPair = new KeyPairSecp256k1('Cqmi5vHc59U1MHhq7JCxTSJentvVBYMcKGUA7s7kwnKn');\nconst publicKey = PublicKey.from('secp256k1:45KcWwYt6MYRnnWFSxyQVkuu9suAzxoSkUMEnFNBi9kDayTo5YPUaqMWUrf7YHUDNMMj3w75vKuvfAMgfiFXBy28');\nexpect(publicKey.verify(message, signature.signature)).toBeTruthy();\n```\n- A specific key pair is created from a base64 string.\n- The signature is verified against the public key.\n\n#### Test 3: Validate Public Key Creation\n```typescript\nexpect(keyPair.publicKey.toString()).toEqual('secp256k1:45KcWwYt6MYRnnWFSxyQVkuu9suAzxoSkUMEnFNBi9kDayTo5YPUaqMWUrf7YHUDNMMj3w75vKuvfAMgfiFXBy28');\n```\n- Verifies that the public key derived from a specific private key matches the expected string representation.\n\n#### Test 4: Convert Key to String and Back\n```typescript\nconst newKeyPair = KeyPair.fromString(keyPair.toString());\nexpect((newKeyPair as KeyPairSecp256k1).secretKey).toEqual(keyPair.secretKey);\n```\n- Tests that converting a key pair to a string and back yields the same secret key.\n\n#### Test 5: Handle Invalid Public Key Length\n```typescript\nconst tooShortPublicKey = 'tooShortPublicKey';\nexpect(() => PublicKey.fromString(baseEncode(tooShortPublicKey))).toThrow(`Invalid public key size (${tooShortPublicKey.length}), must be 32`);\n```\n- Validates that an error is thrown when attempting to create a public key from a string that is too short.\n\n#### Test 6: Validating Public Key Creation from String\n```typescript\nconst validPublicKey = '0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF';\nexpect(() => PublicKey.fromString(baseEncode(validPublicKey))).not.toThrow();\n```\n- Ensures that a valid public key string does not throw an error when converted.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis test suite effectively verifies the integrity of key pair operations in the NEAR Protocol, ensuring that keys can be generated, used for signing, converted to strings, and validated without errors. Each test focuses on a specific aspect of key management, which is crucial for the security and functionality of applications built on blockchain technology."}]}

It initializes the properties of the `Token` object.\n\n3. **Parameters**:\n   - The constructor takes four parameters:\n     - `token_id`: A unique identifier for the NFT. This is crucial for distinguishing one NFT from another.\n     - `owner_id`: This represents the account ID of the current owner of the NFT. It is essential for tracking ownership and transferability.\n     - `metadata`: This parameter is designed to hold additional information about the NFT, such as its name, description, and any related media (images, videos, etc.). Metadata is often encoded in a structured format, such as JSON.\n     - `approved_account_ids`: This is an optional parameter that holds a list of account IDs that have been granted permission to manage or transfer the NFT on behalf of the current owner. This feature is useful for allowing temporary delegation of control over the NFT.\n\n### Context of Usage\n- The `Token` class is designed to comply with modern NFT standards, which often include metadata for enhancing the user experience and approval lists for managing permissions.\n- By making `metadata` and `approved_account_ids` optional, the implementation provides flexibility for developers, allowing them to create simple NFTs without requiring these fields while still supporting richer, more complex NFTs when desired.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis class serves as a foundational building block for NFTs on the NEAR Protocol, encapsulating key properties that define an NFT and its interactions. The design is consistent with best practices in blockchain development, emphasizing clarity, modularity, and extensibility."}]}

This enables validators to analyze transactions for a potential profit and frontrun them with a transaction of their own.\n```\n- This paragraph explains that **validators** (the nodes responsible for confirming transactions and adding them to the blockchain) have visibility into the transaction pool. \n- Being able to see transactions before they are executed allows validators to potentially identify profitable transactions.\n- **Front running** refers to the practice where a validator might submit their own transaction that takes advantage of the knowledge of pending transactions, effectively “jumping the line” to profit from the information.\n\n### Example Scenario\n\n```markdown\nFor example, imagine that you make a game where users are paid for solving puzzles. If not handled carefully, a validator could swap a transaction with the valid answer for one of its own and claim the prize.\n```\n- This scenario illustrates a practical example of front running:\n  - A game where users are rewarded for solving puzzles.\n  - If the system does not adequately protect against front running, a validator could replace a legitimate transaction (e.g., a user submitting a correct answer) with their own transaction, allowing them to claim the reward unfairly.\n- This highlights the potential risks associated with transaction transparency and the importance of implementing security measures to prevent such exploitation.\n\n### Reference to Further Reading\n\n```markdown\nYou can read more about this in [this blog post](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2020/08/ethereum-is-a-dark-forest).\n```\n- This part provides a link to an external blog post that discusses similar issues in the Ethereum ecosystem, indicating that front running is a broader concern in blockchain networks beyond just NEAR.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe document succinctly explains the concept of front running within the NEAR Protocol, outlines the risks associated with it, and provides a real-world example to illustrate the potential for abuse.

Below, I will break down each section of the checklist and explain its significance in the context of smart contract development.\n\n### Overview of the Checklist\n\nThe checklist is divided into several categories that outline best practices in various aspects of smart contract development, including method visibility, state management, storage, actions, and callback handling. The goal is to help developers identify potential security risks and improve the overall safety of their contracts.\n\n### Breakdown of the Checklist Items\n\n1. **Anatomy**\n   - **All private methods are decorated as `private`.**\n     - **Significance:** This ensures that sensitive methods are not accessible externally, protecting them from unauthorized calls.\n\n2. **Environment**\n   - **`predecessor` and `signer` are used correctly through the entire contract.**\n     - **Significance:** Using these correctly is crucial for understanding who initiated the call and ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific actions.\n\n3. **Storage**\n   - **Each time the state grows, it is ensured that there is enough balance to cover it.**\n     - **Significance:** Smart contracts may require funds to store data on the blockchain. Ensuring sufficient balance prevents out-of-gas errors.\n   - **All collections (i.e., Vector, Map, Tree, etc.) have a unique id.**\n     - **Significance:** Unique identifiers help prevent collisions and ensure data integrity.\n   - **Check for underflow and overflow! In Rust, you can do this by simply adding the `overflow-checks = true` flag in your `Cargo.toml`.**\n     - **Significance:** This prevents bugs and exploits related to unexpected numerical behaviors in arithmetic operations.\n\n4. **Actions**\n   - **When sending money, you leave enough in the contract to cover the storage cost.**\n     - **Significance:** This ensures that the contract can continue to function after a transaction, preventing potential failures due to insufficient funds.\n   - **If you are tracking user's funds, you **deduct them before** sending them back to the user.**\n     - **Significance:** This practice prevents re-entrancy attacks, where an external contract could call back into the vulnerable contract before state changes are finalized.\n\n5. **Callbacks**\n   - **All private callbacks are marked as `private`.**\n     - **Significance:** Similar to private methods, marking callbacks as private protects them from external access.\n   - **All cross-contract calls have a callback.**\n     - **Significance:** Callbacks ensure that the contract can handle responses or errors from cross-contract interactions properly.\n   - **All callbacks check for errors and roll back the state if necessary.**\n     - **Significance:** This prevents the contract from entering an inconsistent state if a call fails.\n   - **All callbacks return money to the `predecessor` if necessary.**\n     - **Significance:** Ensuring funds are returned prevents loss of user funds in the event of an error.\n   - **Callbacks are free of `panic!`.**\n     - **Significance:** Avoiding panic ensures that the contract does not crash unexpectedly, leading to a better user experience.\n   - **All the callbacks are given enough GAS to execute entirely.**\n     - **Significance:** Insufficient gas can cause callbacks to fail, leading to potential loss of funds or state inconsistencies.\n   - **The contract is not left in an exploitable state between a cross-contract call and its callback.**\n     - **Significance:** This guards against vulnerabilities such as re-entrancy attacks, ensuring that the contract's state is secure during external calls.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis checklist is a vital resource for NEAR developers, emphasizing security and robustness in smart contract programming.

Without decoding it, it's challenging to determine its exact content, but here's a general explanation of how to interpret and use such a code snippet in the context of NEAR and mobile applications.\n\n### Understanding the Code Snippet\n\n1. **Base64 Encoding**: The string is encoded in base64 format. Base64 is commonly used to encode binary data into text format so that it can be easily transmitted over mediums that may not support binary data. In this case, it might represent an image file (like a PNG or JPEG) that serves as an icon.\n\n2. **Usage in Mobile Wallet**: In a mobile wallet application, icons are often essential for user interface elements, such as buttons, tabs, and other UI components. This encoded string could be part of the wallet's assets, representing an icon that will be displayed to users.\n\n3. **Decoding**: If you need to use this base64 string, you would typically decode it back into its original binary format to render it as an image in your application. Here’s how you might decode and display it in a JavaScript/TypeScript environment:\n\n   ```typescript\n   // Example of decoding the base64 string in TypeScript\n   const base64Icon = \"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\";\n\n   // Convert the base64 string to a Blob\n   const byteCharacters = atob(base64Icon); // Decode base64\n   const byteNumbers = new Uint8Array(byteCharacters.length);\n   for (let i = 0; i < byteCharacters.length; i++) {\n       byteNumbers[i] = byteCharacters.charCodeAt(i);\n   }\n   const blob = new Blob([byteNumbers], { type: 'image/png' }); // Create a Blob object\n   const imageUrl = URL.createObjectURL(blob); // Create a URL for the Blob\n\n   // Use the imageUrl in an <img> tag\n   const imgElement = document.createElement('img');\n   imgElement.src = imageUrl;\n   document.body.appendChild(imgElement); // Append the image to the body\n   ```\n\n### Summary\n\n- The code snippet is a base64-encoded string representing an image or icon used in the NEAR mobile wallet.\n- To utilize it, you need to decode it, typically using the `atob` function in JavaScript, and then create a Blob that can be displayed in an `<img>` element or used in other UI components.\n- This approach helps keep the assets bundled with the application and can be useful for optimizing load times and resource management. \n\nIf you have further questions about this code snippet or need assistance with other aspects of NEAR development, feel free to ask!"}]}

It uses Rust's built-in testing framework to validate the functionality of the `LegacyTreeMap`, which is a data structure designed to store key-value pairs in a tree-like format. Let's break down the key components of this code snippet:\n\n### Code Explanation\n\n1. **Test functions**:\n   Each `#[test]` annotated function is a unit test that checks a specific behavior or set of behaviors of the `LegacyTreeMap`.\n\n2. **Setup and Initialization**:\n   - `let mut map: LegacyTreeMap<u32, u32> = LegacyTreeMap::new(next_trie_id());` initializes a new instance of `LegacyTreeMap`. The `next_trie_id()` function presumably generates a unique identifier for the underlying trie structure.\n\n3. **Test Cases**:\n   - **`test_remove_n`**:\n     - This test checks the removal of multiple elements. It generates a random vector of `n` elements, inserts them into the `map`, and ensures that after removal, the map is empty, and all elements were indeed removed.\n     - A `HashSet` is used to store unique elements for comparison.\n\n   - **`test_remove_root_3`**:\n     - This test examines the removal of a single element from the map and verifies that the remaining elements can still be accessed as expected.\n     - It ensures that after removing an element, the map still contains the correct number of elements and that the removed element is no longer accessible.\n\n   - **`test_insert_2_remove_2_regression`**:\n     - This test checks the behavior of inserting and removing elements. It specifically looks for regressions in the tree height after performing these operations to ensure that the data structure maintains its efficiency.\n\n   - **`test_insert_n_duplicates`**:\n     - This test validates the handling of duplicate keys, ensuring that inserting the same key multiple times does not lead to unexpected behavior. It checks that the map's length and the values remain consistent.\n\n   - **`test_insert_2n_remove_n_random`**:\n     - This test inserts a number of random elements and subsequently removes them, checking the integrity of the structure and the correctness of its length and height after operations.\n\n   - **`test_remove_empty`**:\n     - This test confirms that removing a key from an empty map returns `None`, which is the expected behavior.\n\n   - **`test_to_vec`**:\n     - Although not fully shown, this test likely checks the ability to convert the contents of the `LegacyTreeMap` into a vector format, validating the structure's current keys and values.\n\n### Key Assertions\n- Throughout the tests, assertions are made using `assert_eq!` which checks that the expected values match the actual values returned from the `LegacyTreeMap` methods. This is critical for ensuring that the map behaves according to its specifications.\n\n### Summary\nThe tests ensure that the `LegacyTreeMap` behaves correctly under various scenarios including insertion, removal, and edge cases such as handling duplicates and empty states. They validate that the underlying data structure maintains its properties and behaves as expected when subjected to typical operations expected of a map-like structure.\n\n### Recommendations\n- When writing tests, it's essential to cover edge cases and potential failure points (e.g., inserting duplicates, removing from an empty map).\n- Ensure that performance metrics (like height in tree structures) are monitored to prevent inefficiencies.\n- Tests should be run frequently during development to catch regressions early.\n\nThis thorough testing approach helps ensure the reliability and correctness of the `LegacyTreeMap` implementation in the NEAR Protocol's SDK."}]}

This kind of string is often used to represent binary data, such as images, compressed files, or other types of data that need to be stored in a text format.\n\n### Understanding the Code Snippet\n\n1. **Base64 Encoding**: \n   - The string starts with `0MVEgTyKHfGtHzyURkjHQKJ9...` and is a lengthy sequence of characters including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters like `+` and `/`. This is characteristic of base64 encoding.\n   - Base64 encoding is commonly used to convert binary data into a text representation, which can be easily transmitted over text-based protocols.\n\n2. **Purpose in NEAR Protocol**:\n   - In the context of NEAR Protocol, such encoded strings may be used for various purposes, including:\n     - **Storing Assets**: Representing images or asset data in a smart contract or decentralized application (dApp) on the NEAR blockchain.\n     - **Configuration**: Storing configuration data or keys in a format that can be easily serialized/deserialized.\n     - **Serialization of Complex Data**: Saving complex objects or arrays in a compact format.\n\n3. **Decoding the String**:\n   - To understand what this data represents, you would need to decode it from base64 back into its original binary format. In JavaScript, you can use the following method:\n\n   ```javascript\n   const base64String = '0MVEgTyKHfGtHzyURkjHQKJ9...'; // Your base64 string here\n   const binaryData = Buffer.from(base64String, 'base64'); // Decoding the base64 string\n\n   // If it's a string, you can convert it like this\n   const decodedString = binaryData.toString('utf-8');\n   console.log(decodedString);\n   ```\n\n### Final Notes\n- If you are looking for a specific functionality or purpose related to this encoded string in the NEAR Protocol or the `icon.ts` file, you might want to check the surrounding code in the file or documentation for details on how this encoded string is utilized.\n- If it's part of a smart contract, it could define an icon or image associated with a token, dApp, or other assets within the NEAR ecosystem.\n- For a complete understanding, consider reviewing the entire context in which this string is used, including imports, class definitions, and any methods that manipulate or consume this data."}]}

Below, I will break down the different parts of the snippet, providing explanations for what each section does.\n\n### Deploying the Contract\n\n```bash\ncargo near deploy $NFT_CONTRACT_ID without-init-call network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send\n```\n\n- **`cargo near deploy`**: This command is used to deploy the smart contract to the NEAR blockchain using the `cargo-near` tool.\n- **`$NFT_CONTRACT_ID`**: This is an environment variable that should be set to the ID of the account where the NFT contract will be deployed.\n- **`without-init-call`**: This flag indicates that the contract should be deployed without an initialization call. This is typically used when the contract has already been initialized and you just want to redeploy it.\n- **`network-config testnet`**: Specifies that the deployment is happening on the NEAR testnet, a testing environment that mimics the main network but uses test tokens.\n- **`sign-with-keychain`**: Indicates that the deployment should be signed using NEAR's keychain.\n- **`send`**: This flag indicates that the command should send the transaction to the network.\n\n### Environment Setup Tip\n\n```markdown\n:::tip\nIf you haven't completed the previous tutorials and are just following along with this one, simply create an account and login with your CLI using `near login`. You can then export an environment variable `export NFT_CONTRACT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID_HERE`.\n:::\n```\n\nThis section instructs users to create an account on NEAR and log in using the command line interface (CLI). It also shows how to set the `NFT_CONTRACT_ID` variable with the user's account ID, which is critical for the following deployment and testing steps.\n\n### Testing the New Changes\n\nAfter deploying the contract, the tutorial moves on to testing the changes made to the contract. The focus here is on the `nft_transfer` method.\n\n```markdown\n### Testing the transfer function\n```\n\nThis section explains how to test the `nft_transfer` function by transferring an NFT from one account to another. It emphasizes that after the transfer, the NFT should no longer appear in the original owner's list of collectibles.\n\n#### Transfer Command Example\n\n```bash\nnear call $NFT_CONTRACT_ID nft_transfer '{\"receiver_id\": \"benjiman.testnet\", \"token_id\": \"token-1\", \"memo\": \"Go Team :)\"}' --gas 100000000000000 --depositYocto 1 --accountId $NFT_CONTRACT_ID --networkId testnet\n```\n\n- **`near call`**: This command is used to invoke a method on a smart contract.\n- **`$NFT_CONTRACT_ID`**: The ID of the NFT contract being interacted with.\n- **`nft_transfer`**: The method being called to transfer the NFT.\n- **`'{\"receiver_id\": \"benjiman.testnet\", \"token_id\": \"token-1\", \"memo\": \"Go Team :)\"}'`**: JSON arguments specifying the receiver's account, the token ID being transferred, and an optional memo.\n- **`--gas 100000000000000`**: Specifies the amount of gas to be used for the transaction.\n- **`--depositYocto 1`**: Indicates that a deposit of 1 yoctoNEAR (the smallest unit of NEAR) is attached to the transaction.\n- **`--accountId $NFT_CONTRACT_ID`**: The account that is calling the contract method.\n- **`--networkId testnet`**: Specifies that the transaction is being sent to the testnet.\n\n### Testing the Transfer Call Function\n\nFollowing the standard transfer test, the tutorial covers testing the `nft_transfer_call` function, which allows for additional logic to be executed at the receiving contract via a callback.\n\n```markdown\nIf you try to transfer an NFT to a receiver that does **not** implement the `nft_on_transfer` function, the contract will panic and the NFT will **not** be transferred.\n```\n\nThis highlights an important aspect of the NEAR NFT standard, where the receiving contract must implement a specific callback function to handle the NFT appropriately. If not, the transaction fails, ensuring that NFTs are not transferred to incompatible contracts.\n\n### Summary\n\nOverall, this code snippet provides a clear instructional guide on how to deploy and test an NFT contract on NEAR.

This structure provides functionality to serialize and deserialize the `SignedDelegateAction` into and from a Base64 encoded string. Let's break down the code step-by-step:\n\n### Imports\n\n```rust\nuse near_primitives::{borsh, borsh::BorshDeserialize};\n```\n\n- The code imports the `borsh` crate and its `BorshDeserialize` trait from the `near_primitives` library. Borsh (Binary Object Representation Serializer for Hashing) is used for serialization and deserialization of data structures in NEAR.\n\n### Structure Definition\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Debug, Clone)]\npub struct SignedDelegateActionAsBase64 {\n    pub inner: near_primitives::action::delegate::SignedDelegateAction,\n}\n```\n\n- `SignedDelegateActionAsBase64` is defined as a public struct that contains a single field, `inner`, which holds a `SignedDelegateAction`. \n- The `#[derive(Debug, Clone)]` attribute allows instances of this struct to be printed using the `Debug` formatter and to be cloned.\n\n### `FromStr` Implementation\n\n```rust\nimpl std::str::FromStr for SignedDelegateActionAsBase64 {\n    type Err = String;\n\n    fn from_str(s: &str) -> Result<Self, Self::Err> {\n        Ok(Self {\n            inner: near_primitives::action::delegate::SignedDelegateAction::try_from_slice(\n                &near_primitives::serialize::from_base64(s)\n                .map_err(|err| format!(\"parsing of signed delegate action failed due to base64 sequence being invalid: {}\", err))?,\n            )\n            .map_err(|err| format!(\"delegate action could not be deserialized from borsh: {}\", err))?,\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n- This implementation allows the `SignedDelegateActionAsBase64` struct to be created from a `&str` using the `from_str` method.\n- The method first attempts to decode the Base64 string into bytes using `near_primitives::serialize::from_base64`.\n- If successful, it attempts to deserialize these bytes into a `SignedDelegateAction` using `try_from_slice`.\n- If either operation fails, a formatted error message is returned.\n\n### `Display` Implementation\n\n```rust\nimpl std::fmt::Display for SignedDelegateActionAsBase64 {\n    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut std::fmt::Formatter<'_>) -> std::fmt::Result {\n        let base64_signed_delegate_action = near_primitives::serialize::to_base64(\n            &borsh::to_vec(&self.inner)\n                .expect(\"Signed Delegate Action serialization to borsh is not expected to fail\"),\n        );\n        write!(f, \"{}\", base64_signed_delegate_action)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n- This implementation allows the `SignedDelegateActionAsBase64` to be formatted as a string.\n- It serializes the `inner` field back to Borsh format and then encodes it to a Base64 string.\n- The resulting Base64 string is written to the formatter, allowing it to be printed or stored.\n\n### `ToCli` Implementation\n\n```rust\nimpl interactive_clap::ToCli for SignedDelegateActionAsBase64 {\n    type CliVariant = SignedDelegateActionAsBase64;\n}\n```\n\n- This implementation makes `SignedDelegateActionAsBase64` compatible with the `interactive_clap` CLI library, allowing it to be used as a command line interface variant.\n\n### `From` Implementation\n\n```rust\nimpl From<near_primitives::action::delegate::SignedDelegateAction>\n    for SignedDelegateActionAsBase64\n{\n    fn from(value: near_primitives::action::delegate::SignedDelegateAction) -> Self {\n        Self { inner: value }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n- This `From` implementation provides a way to convert a `SignedDelegateAction` directly into a `SignedDelegateActionAsBase64`. This is useful for simplifying conversions within the codebase.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, the `SignedDelegateActionAsBase64` struct provides a convenient wrapper around the `SignedDelegateAction` to enable easy Base64 encoding and decoding. It implements traits for string conversion and command-line interface compatibility, facilitating its use in different contexts within the NEAR ecosystem. The error handling is done gracefully to provide informative messages in case of serialization or deserialization failures."}]}

Based on Polkadot's consensus mechanism\nthere will be a need for verification of ~200 signatures every minute\n(Polkadot’s authority set is ~300 signers and it may be increased in the future: https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referendum/16).\n\nTherefore, a mechanism to perform these operations cost-effectively in terms\nof gas and speed would be highly beneficial to have. Currently, NEAR does not have any native signature verification toolbox.\nThis implies that a light client operating inside NEAR will have to import a library\ncompiled to WASM as mentioned in [Zulip](https://near.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/295302-general/topic/light_client).\n\nPolkadot uses [three different cryptographic schemes](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-keys)\nfor its keys/accounts, which also translates into different signature types. However, for this NEP the focus is on:\n\n- The vanilla ed25519 implementation uses Schnorr signatures.\n\n## Rationale and alternatives\n\nAdd a signature verification signatures function into the runtime as host functions.\n\n- ED25519 signature verification function using `ed25519_dalek` crates into NEAR runtime as pre-compiled functions.\n\nBenchmarks were run using a signature verifier smart contract on-chain importing the aforementioned functions from\nwidespread used crypto Rust crates. The biggest pitfall of these functions running wasm code instead of native\nis performance and gas cost.

This is particularly relevant for decentralized applications that require robust and fast cryptographic operations, such as light clients in PoS ecosystems. The benchmarks provided demonstrate the need for such functionality to optimize performance and reduce gas costs, making the NEAR Protocol more competitive and efficient.\n\nThis document serves as a technical specification for developers and stakeholders interested in improving NEAR's capabilities, especially in the context of interoperability and scalability in blockchain networks."}]}

Some of these may be more easily swapped for other approaches while others require more internal knowledge about system calls.\n\n## Small wins\n\n### Using flags\n\nWhen compiling a contract make sure to pass flag `-C link-arg=-s` to the rust compiler:\n\n```bash\nRUSTFLAGS='-C link-arg=-s' cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release\n```\n\nHere is the parameters we use for the most examples in `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[profile.release]\ncodegen-units = 1\nopt-level = \"s\"\nlto = true\ndebug = false\npanic = \"abort\"\noverflow-checks = true\n```\n\nYou may want to experiment with using `opt-level = \"z\"` instead of `opt-level = \"s\"` to see if generates a smaller binary. See more details on this in [The Cargo Book Profiles section](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#opt-level). You may also reference this [Shrinking .wasm Size](https://rustwasm.github.io/book/reference/code-size.html#tell-llvm-to-optimize-for-size-instead-of-speed) resource.\n\n### Removing `rlib` from the manifest\n\nEnsure that your manifest (`Cargo.toml`) doesn't contain `rlib` unless it needs to. Some NEAR examples have included this:\n\n:::caution Adds unnecessary bloat\n\n```toml\n[lib]\ncrate-type = [\"cdylib\", \"rlib\"]\n```\n:::\n\n  when it could be:\n\n:::tip\n\n```toml\n[lib]\ncrate-type = [\"cdylib\"]\n```\n:::\n\n3. When using the Rust SDK, you may override the default JSON serialization to use [Borsh](https://borsh.io) instead. [See this page](./serialization-interface.md#overriding-serialization-protocol-default) for more information and an example.\n4. When using assertions or guards, avoid using the standard `assert` macros like [`assert!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.assert.html), [`assert_eq!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.assert_eq.html), or [`assert_ne!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.assert_ne.html) as these may add bloat for information regarding the line number of the error. There are similar issues with `unwrap`, `expect`, and Rust's `panic!()` macro.\n\n  Example of a standard assertion:\n\n  :::caution Adds unnecessary bloat\n\n  ```rust\n  assert_eq!(contract_owner, predecessor_account, \"ERR_NOT_OWNER\");\n  ```\n  :::\n\n  when it could be:\n\n  :::tip\n\n  ```rust\n  if contract_owner != predecessor_account {\n    env::panic(b\"ERR_NOT_OWNER\");\n  }\n  ```\n  :::\n\n  Example of removing `expect`:\n\n  :::caution Adds unnecessary bloat\n\n  ```rust\n  let owner_id = self.owner_by_id.get(&token_id).expect(\"Token not found\");\n  ```\n  :::\n\n  when it could be:\n\n  :::tip\n\n  ```rust\n  fn expect_token_found<T>(option: Option<T>) -> T {\n    option.unwrap_or_else(|| env::panic_str(\"Token not found\"))\n  }\n  let owner_id = expect_token_found(self.owner_by_id.get(&token_id));  \n  ```\n  :::\n\n  Example of changing standard `panic!()`:\n\n  :::caution Adds unnecessary bloat\n\n  ```rust\n  panic!(\"ERR_MSG_HERE\"); \n  ```\n  :::\n\n  when it could be:\n\n  :::tip\n\n  ```rust\n  env::panic_str(\"ERR_MSG_HERE\");  \n  ```\n  :::\n\n## Ready to use script\nWe have prepared a simple `bash` script that can be used to minify `.wasm` contract file. You can find it [here](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs/blob/master/minifier/minify.sh).\n\nThe current approach to minification is the following:\n1. Snip (i.e. just replace with unreachable instruction) few known fat functions from the standard library (such as float formatting and panic-related) with `wasm-snip`.\n```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The provided code snippet is a markdown document from the NEAR Protocol repository that outlines strategies for reducing the size of smart contracts written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly (WASM). Below is a breakdown of the content, explaining the key concepts and recommendations for developers who are looking to optimize their contract sizes.\n\n### Overview of the Document\n\n- **Title**: \"Reducing Contract Size\"\n- **Purpose**: This document is aimed at developers who have a foundational understanding of low-level programming concepts and want to minimize their smart contract's size, even if this comes at the cost of code readability.\n\n### Key Sections Explained\n\n#### Common Scenarios for Size Reduction\n- Smart contracts that handle account management.\n- Contracts deployed via factory patterns.\n- Future enhancements similar to Ethereum's EVM on the NEAR platform.\n\n#### Small Wins: Techniques for Reducing Size\n\n1. **Using Compiler Flags**:\n   - To reduce the size of the compiled contract, you should use the following Rust compiler flag:\n   ```bash\n   RUSTFLAGS='-C link-arg=-s' cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release\n   ```\n   - This flag instructs the compiler to strip debugging information and symbols from the output, thereby reducing the size.\n\n2. **Optimizing Cargo.toml Settings**:\n   - The document provides a recommended configuration for the `Cargo.toml` file under the `[profile.release]` section:\n   ```toml\n   [profile.release]\n   codegen-units = 1\n   opt-level = \"s\"  # Optimize for size\n   lto = true       # Link Time Optimization\n   debug = false    # No debug info\n   panic = \"abort\"  # Abort on panic instead of unwinding\n   overflow-checks = true  # Enable overflow checks\n   ```\n   - It suggests experimenting with `opt-level = \"z\"` for potentially smaller binaries.\n\n3. **Removing Unnecessary Library Types**:\n   - Avoid including the `rlib` crate type unless necessary, as it can add bloat. The example shows the difference:\n   ```toml\n   [lib]\n   crate-type = [\"cdylib\", \"rlib\"]  # Avoid this\n   ```\n   - Instead, use:\n   ```toml\n   [lib]\n   crate-type = [\"cdylib\"]  # Recommended\n   ```\n\n4. **Serialization Optimization**:\n   - When using the Rust SDK, consider using Borsh serialization instead of the default JSON serialization to save space.\n\n5. **Avoiding Bloat from Assertions**:\n   - Standard assertion macros (`assert!`, `assert_eq!`, etc.) can add bloat due to additional information like line numbers. Instead, use manual checks and `env::panic` for error handling.\n   - Example of a less bulky alternative:\n   ```rust\n   if contract_owner != predecessor_account {\n       env::panic(b\"ERR_NOT_OWNER\");\n   }\n   ```\n\n6. **Alternative to `expect` and `panic!` Macros**:\n   - Using custom functions for error handling can help reduce the size. Instead of using `expect`, which might add unnecessary context, use:\n   ```rust\n   fn expect_token_found<T>(option: Option<T>) -> T {\n       option.unwrap_or_else(|| env::panic_str(\"Token not found\"))\n   }\n   ```\n\n#### Minification Script\n- The document concludes by mentioning a ready-to-use bash script that helps minify `.wasm` contract files. This script utilizes `wasm-snip` to remove known larger functions from the standard library, such as those related to float formatting and panic handling.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis document provides practical advice and concrete examples for developers looking to optimize the size of their smart contracts on NEAR. By carefully adjusting compiler flags, modifying project configurations, and adopting alternative coding practices, developers can significantly reduce the size of their WASM binaries, which can lead to lower deployment costs and improved efficiency. \n\nFor developers working with NEAR, understanding and implementing these strategies can help create more efficient smart contracts that still maintain the necessary functionality."}]}

The code defines several traits and methods for transforming specific error types into a more general `Error` type used throughout the application. Below, I will break down the components of the code snippet to explain its functionality.\n\n### Key Components\n\n1. **Error Handling Structure**\n   - The code defines how errors are represented and transformed in the NEAR Protocol. Specifically, it seems to focus on two types of errors: `SandboxErrorCode` and `RpcErrorCode`.\n\n2. **Error Conversion Implementations**\n   - There are multiple `From` trait implementations that allow for seamless conversion from specific error types (like `PoisonError<T>`, `SandboxErrorCode`, and `RpcErrorCode`) into a general `Error` type. This is done to provide a consistent way of handling errors throughout the codebase.\n\n3. **Error Methods**\n   - The `message`, `custom`, and `full` methods are defined for both `SandboxErrorCode` and `RpcErrorCode`. These methods facilitate the creation of `Error` instances with varying levels of detail.\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n1. **Conversion from `PoisonError<T>`**\n   ```rust\n   impl<T> From<PoisonError<T>> for Error {\n       fn from(value: PoisonError<T>) -> Self {\n           Self::custom(ErrorKind::Other, value.to_string())\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n   - This implementation allows an error of type `PoisonError<T>` to be converted into a `Error` type. The `ErrorKind::Other` is used to categorize this error, and the error message is derived from `value.to_string()`.\n\n2. **Methods for `SandboxErrorCode`**\n   ```rust\n   impl SandboxErrorCode {\n       pub(crate) fn message<T>(self, msg: T) -> Error\n       where\n           T: Into<Cow<'static, str>>,\n       {\n           Error::message(ErrorKind::Sandbox(self), msg)\n       }\n   ```\n   - The `message` method creates a new `Error` with a specific message associated with a `SandboxErrorCode`. The `msg` parameter is transformed into a `Cow<'static, str>`, which is a flexible type for string data.\n\n   ```rust\n   pub(crate) fn custom<E>(self, error: E) -> Error\n   where\n       E: Into<Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync>>,\n   {\n       Error::custom(ErrorKind::Sandbox(self), error)\n   }\n   ```\n   - The `custom` method allows for wrapping any custom error that implements the `std::error::Error` trait into a `SandboxError`.\n\n   ```rust\n   pub(crate) fn full<T, E>(self, msg: T, error: E) -> Error\n   where\n       T: Into<Cow<'static, str>>,\n       E: Into<Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync>>,\n   {\n       Error::full(ErrorKind::Sandbox(self), msg, error)\n   }\n   ```\n   - The `full` method combines both a message and a custom error into a new `Error`.\n\n3. **Conversion from `SandboxErrorCode` to `Error`**\n   ```rust\n   impl From<SandboxErrorCode> for Error {\n       fn from(code: SandboxErrorCode) -> Self {\n           Self::simple(ErrorKind::Sandbox(code))\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n   - This `From` implementation allows a `SandboxErrorCode` to be directly converted to an `Error`, using `ErrorKind::Sandbox` as the category.\n\n4. **Methods for `RpcErrorCode`**\n   - Similar methods (`message`, `custom`, and `from`) are defined for `RpcErrorCode`, allowing for structured error handling in the context of remote procedure calls (RPC).\n\n### Summary\nOverall, the code snippet demonstrates a structured approach to error handling in the NEAR Protocol. By utilizing Rust's trait system, the implementation allows for easy conversion between various error types and a centralized `Error` type, which can carry detailed information about errors that occur in different parts of the application. This is crucial for debugging and maintaining robust error reporting in decentralized applications (dApps) built on the NEAR Protocol."}]}

It specifically sets up a development configuration for Webpack, which is a popular module bundler for JavaScript applications. Let's break down the components of this snippet.\n\n### Code Explanation\n\n```javascript\nconst { merge } = require('webpack-merge');\n```\n- This line imports the `merge` function from the `webpack-merge` package. The `merge` function is used to combine multiple Webpack configurations into a single configuration object. This is useful for maintaining a base configuration while allowing for specific adjustments in different environments (like development, production, etc.).\n\n```javascript\nconst baseConfig = require('./webpack.common.config');\n```\n- Here, the code imports a common Webpack configuration defined in `webpack.common.config.js`. This common configuration typically contains settings that are shared across different environments, such as module rules, plugins, and entry points.\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = merge(baseConfig, {\n  devtool: 'eval-source-map',\n});\n```\n- This line exports the merged configuration object. The `merge` function combines `baseConfig` with an additional configuration object that specifies the `devtool` property.\n- The `devtool: 'eval-source-map'` setting enables source maps for easier debugging during development. The `eval-source-map` option provides high-quality source maps by using `eval()` to include the original source code in the bundle, which allows for fast rebuilds and better debugging experience. However, it can also lead to larger bundle sizes and slower performance compared to other source map options.\n\n### Summary\nThis Webpack development configuration file combines a base configuration with specific settings for the development environment, particularly focusing on enabling source maps for improved debugging. The use of the `webpack-merge` package allows for clean separation of common and environment-specific configurations, facilitating maintainability and clarity in the codebase.\n\n### Additional Note on Source Maps\nSource maps are crucial for debugging because they map the transformed code (the code after it has been processed by Webpack) back to the original source code, enabling developers to see the original file and line number where an error occurred. The choice of source map strategy can significantly affect both the debugging experience and performance during development."}]}

Let's break down the key components and functionalities of the code snippet.\n\n### Light Client Overview\n\nA light client is a type of blockchain client that only downloads and verifies a subset of the blockchain data necessary to ensure security and correctness without having to store the entire blockchain. In the NEAR Protocol, light clients are defined by:\n\n1. **Current Block Header**: The `BlockHeaderInnerLiteView` structure provides essential metadata about the current head of the blockchain, including:\n   - `height`: The block height.\n   - `epoch_id`: The identifier of the current epoch.\n   - `next_epoch_id`: The identifier of the upcoming epoch.\n   - `prev_state_root`: The hash of the previous state.\n   - `outcome_root`: The hash of the outcomes for the block.\n   - `timestamp`: The time the block was produced.\n   - `next_bp_hash`: The hash of the block producers set for the next epoch.\n   - `block_merkle_root`: The Merkle root of all block hashes.\n\n2. **Block Producers**: The light client keeps track of the set of block producers for the current and next epochs to validate blocks and their outcomes.\n\n### Fetching and Validating Light Client Block Views\n\nLight clients fetch instances of `LightClientBlockView` via specific RPC endpoints. They don't need to fetch data for every block; if they have a `LightClientBlockView` for a block `B`, they can verify statements about the state of any block in its ancestry. However, to validate a `LightClientBlockView`, the light client must first have verified a block from the preceding epoch.\n\n### Code Structures\n\nThe key structures defined in the Rust code include:\n\n- **ApprovalInner**: An enum that signifies whether a block has been endorsed or skipped by a validator.\n- **ValidatorStakeView**: Contains the account ID, public key, and stake amount of a validator.\n- **BlockHeaderInnerLiteView**: Holds the essential data about the block header, such as height, epoch IDs, and Merkle roots.\n- **LightClientBlockLiteView**: Represents a lightweight view of a block, containing the previous block hash and a reference to the inner lite block header.\n- **LightClientBlockView**: This includes the necessary fields to validate a block view, such as previous block hash, next block inner hash, and the list of validator approvals.\n\n### Hash Reconstruction\n\nThe hash of a block is computed through a nested SHA-256 hashing process, which combines Borsh-serialized data of the inner lite block header and the inner rest hash. This is critical for ensuring the integrity and immutability of block data.\n\n### Updating the Light Client's Head\n\nWhen updating its view of the blockchain, the light client must satisfy several conditions:\n\n1. The block's height must be greater than the current head.\n2. The block's epoch must match either the current or next epoch.\n3. If the block is from the next epoch, the `next_bps` should not be `None`.\n4. The `approvals_after_next` must contain valid signatures from block producers.\n5. The signatures must represent more than 2/3 of the total stake.\n6. The hash of the next block producers must match the expected hash in the current block header.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis light client implementation is crucial for enabling lightweight nodes to interact with the NEAR blockchain efficiently. By fetching only the necessary data, light clients can maintain security and verify transactions without the overhead of maintaining the entire blockchain state. The provided code serves as a foundation for the functionality required to fetch, validate, and update light client block views in the NEAR ecosystem."}]}

the integration tests for a multi-party computation (MPC) contract within the NEAR Protocol ecosystem. Let's break down the key components of the code to understand its functionality and structure.\n\n### Overview\n\nThe code defines a structure `MultichainTestContext` which encapsulates the state and behavior needed for testing multi-chain interactions, particularly for adding and removing participants in an MPC process. It utilizes asynchronous programming patterns in Rust, leveraging the `tokio` runtime for handling concurrency.\n\n### Key Components\n\n1. **Module Imports**:\n   ```rust\n   mod actions;\n   mod cases;\n   ```\n   These lines indicate that the `actions` and `cases` modules are included. They likely contain reusable functions and test cases relevant to the integration tests.\n\n2. **Dependencies**:\n   ```rust\n   use crate::actions::wait_for;\n   use mpc_contract::update::{ProposeUpdateArgs, UpdateId};\n   ```\n   These imports bring in necessary types and functions, particularly for waiting on certain conditions and handling MPC contract updates.\n\n3. **Futures and Clients**:\n   ```rust\n   use futures::future::BoxFuture;\n   use integration_tests_chain_signatures::containers::DockerClient;\n   use integration_tests_chain_signatures::utils::{vote_join, vote_leave};\n   ```\n   The code uses `futures` for asynchronous programming and imports utility functions for managing votes to join or leave the MPC.\n\n4. **NEAR Workspaces**:\n   ```rust\n   use near_workspaces::types::NearToken;\n   use near_workspaces::{Account, AccountId, Contract};\n   ```\n   These imports are from the `near_workspaces` library, which provides abstractions for interacting with NEAR accounts and contracts.\n\n5. **Constants**:\n   ```rust\n   const CURRENT_CONTRACT_DEPLOY_DEPOSIT: NearToken = NearToken::from_millinear(9000);\n   const CURRENT_CONTRACT_FILE_PATH: &str = \"../../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/mpc_contract.wasm\";\n   ```\n   Constants define the deployment deposit required and the path to the compiled WASM contract.\n\n6. **Struct Definition**:\n   ```rust\n   pub struct MultichainTestContext<'a> {\n       nodes: Nodes<'a>,\n       rpc_client: near_fetch::Client,\n       http_client: reqwest::Client,\n       cfg: MultichainConfig,\n   }\n   ```\n   The `MultichainTestContext` struct holds relevant data for the test context, including nodes, RPC and HTTP clients, and configuration.\n\n7. **Method Implementations**:\n   - **`contract`**:\n     ```rust\n     pub fn contract(&self) -> &Contract {\n         self.nodes.contract()\n     }\n     ```\n     This method simply returns a reference to the contract associated with the nodes.\n\n   - **`participant_accounts`**:\n     ```rust\n     pub async fn participant_accounts(&self) -> anyhow::Result<Vec<&Account>> {\n         let state = wait_for::running_mpc(self, None).await?;\n         let participant_ids = state.participants.keys().collect::<HashSet<_>>();\n         let mut node_accounts = self.nodes.near_accounts();\n         node_accounts.retain(|a| participant_ids.contains(a.id()));\n         Ok(node_accounts)\n     }\n     ```\n     This asynchronous method retrieves the participant accounts currently involved in the MPC. It waits for the MPC to be running and filters the accounts based on the current participants.\n\n   - **`add_participant`**:\n     ```rust\n     pub async fn add_participant(\n         &mut self,\n         existing_node: Option<NodeConfig>,\n     ) -> anyhow::Result<()> {\n         // ... logic to add a participant\n     }\n     ```\n     This method adds a participant to the MPC. It checks if the participant already exists, starts a node for the new participant, and ensures that the required votes are cast to add the participant successfully.\n\n   - **`remove_participant`**:\n     ```rust\n     pub async fn remove_participant(\n         &mut self,\n         kick: Option<&AccountId>,\n     ) -> anyhow::Result<NodeConfig> {\n         // ... logic to remove a participant\n     }\n     ```\n     This method handles the removal of a participant. It filters out the account to be kicked and ensures that votes are cast to successfully remove that participant from the MPC.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis snippet is a part of a testing framework for an MPC contract on the NEAR blockchain. It provides functionality to manage participants in an MPC scenario, demonstrating asynchronous programming with Rust, as well as interactions with NEAR's blockchain environment. The use of logging and assertions helps ensure that operations are performed correctly, and errors are handled gracefully with the `anyhow` crate for error management. \n\nOverall, this code serves as an essential component in ensuring the correct behavior of the MPC contract under different scenarios of participant management."}]}

The file `integers.rs` is likely involved in defining custom types that wrap around standard Rust integer types (like `u64` and `i64`) to add additional functionality or constraints relevant to NEAR's usage.\n\n### Breakdown of the Code Snippet\n\n1. **Testing U64 Type:**\n   ```rust\n   de!(U64, u64, 2u64.pow(60));\n   test_serde!(U64, u64, u64::MAX);\n   assert!(U64::from(u64::MIN) < U64::from(u64::MAX));\n   ```\n   - `de!(U64, u64, 2u64.pow(60));`: This macro (likely a custom macro defined elsewhere in the code) is testing the deserialization of the `U64` type, which wraps the `u64` Rust type. The value `2u64.pow(60)` is being used as a test case for its maximum capacity.\n   - `test_serde!(U64, u64, u64::MAX);`: This macro tests the serialization and deserialization (serde) of the maximum value for `u64`. It ensures that the value can be correctly serialized into a format (e.g., JSON) and then deserialized back to its original form.\n   - `assert!(U64::from(u64::MIN) < U64::from(u64::MAX));`: This assertion checks that the minimum value of `u64` is indeed less than its maximum value when wrapped in the `U64` type. This is a sanity check to ensure that the type behaves as expected.\n\n2. **Testing I64 Type:**\n   ```rust\n   #[test]\n   fn test_i64() {\n       test_serde!(I64, i64, 0);\n       test_serde!(I64, i64, 1);\n       test_serde!(I64, i64, -1);\n       test_serde!(I64, i64, 123);\n       test_serde!(I64, i64, 10i64.pow(18));\n       test_serde!(I64, i64, 2i64.pow(60));\n       test_serde!(I64, i64, -(2i64.pow(60)));\n       test_serde!(I64, i64, i64::MAX);\n       test_serde!(I64, i64, i64::MIN);\n       assert!(I64::from(i64::MIN) < I64::from(i64::MAX));\n   }\n   ```\n   - This function, `test_i64`, performs similar tests for the `I64` type, which wraps the `i64` Rust type.\n   - Various test cases are included to check both positive and negative values, including:\n     - Zero (`0`)\n     - Positive integer (`1`)\n     - Negative integer (`-1`)\n     - A random positive integer (`123`)\n     - A large positive number (`10i64.pow(18)`)\n     - The maximum and minimum values of `i64`.\n     - The two extreme values of `i64` are tested: large positive (`2i64.pow(60)`) and large negative (`-(2i64.pow(60))`).\n   - The final assertion checks that `I64::from(i64::MIN)` is less than `I64::from(i64::MAX)`, ensuring that the `I64` type maintains the expected order.\n\n### Summary\nThis code snippet is crucial for testing the behavior of custom integer types in the NEAR Protocol SDK. It ensures that serialization and deserialization work correctly for both unsigned and signed integers, covering a range of values from basic integers to their limits. The use of macros (`de!` and `test_serde!`) suggests that they encapsulate common functionality to reduce code duplication and improve test readability. Overall, this is an important part of ensuring robustness in the data types used within the NEAR Protocol's ecosystem."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the following section of a NEAR Protocol article:\n income, NEAR Protocol allocates 30% of transaction fees to the contracts these transactions touched. For example, if Alice sent a transaction to smart contract A with 0.0001 Ⓝ fee, and contract A doesn’t call any other contracts, it will receive a reward of 0.00003 Ⓝ (which is 30% of 0.0001 Ⓝ). On the other hand, if contract A is using contract B for 50% of its functionality (measured by gas usage), A and B will split the contract reward, each one receiving 0.000015 Ⓝ. This way popular libraries can receive a flow of funds from all the client applications that are using them. Developers of the contracts can program various ways how these funds can be used. For example, they can be kept on the contract to allow it to allocate more storage space. DAO managing this application can decide what to do with these funds. Or there might be some third-party token buy-back & burn mechanics for contracts that have their own token. Account Name Auction NEAR Protocol uses human-readable account names. This allows for much better user experience for regular blockchain use cases. We also expect that these accounts will be used across various novel use cases (e.g., DNS, certification, and applications) as they represent the user’s digital identity that is also connected to finances, data ownership, and cryptography—and, in the future, supporting more of Decentralized Identifier (DID) standard. We split account names into two groups by length: those longer than 32 characters and those shorter. We expect that shorter accounts names will have way more value for users compared to longer ones. Longer account names can register on a first-come-first-serve basis. To give everyone a fair chance to acquire short account names, a naming auction will start shortly after MainNet launch. Each week’s account names—such that sha256(account_id) % 52 is equal to the week since the launch of the auction—will open for bidding. Auctions will run for seven days after the first bid, and anyone can bid for a given name. A bid consists of a bid and mask, allowing the bidder to hide the amount that they are bidding. After the seven days run out, participants must reveal their bid and mask within the next seven days. The winner of the auction pays the second-largest price. Proceeds of the auctions then get burned by the naming contract, benefiting all the token holders. Conclusion NEAR Protocol provides a powerful cryptocurrency Ⓝ, which links together Validators, developers, users and token holders into one ecosystem. Each role has different goals: Users want security for their assets and data. Developers want more adoption and capture a sustainable source of revenue. Validators want to receive higher income for providing validation services. Token holders want their tokens to hold value long term. The goal of the economic design is to align these interests and incentivize the growth of the ecosystem. For example, as the price of Bitcoin grows, so does the security of the network. In other words, BTC becomes a better store of value as it becomes more expensive, and more people want to store their money there. On the other hand, Bitcoin is missing developers and hasn’t yet attracted active development. With NEAR Protocol, as demand for tokens grows from new users and developers and increases usage of applications, we see the alignment of incentives between everyone. Validators will receive a higher income in Ⓝ because there is less staked and more tokens burned (increasing their yield). As more people use the network, their individual usage fees can be kept low while validators are still compensated for storing more data overall, which leads to the network becoming more secure and users (who are also token holders) receiving more security for their assets and data stored on the chain. The network also becomes more attractive as a place for developers to store data and assets because it has higher security and more users. Add it all up, and growth of the demand from users and developers and the reduction of supply via staking, transaction fee burning, and state staking leads to the NEAR token balancing good utility for users and developers with what validators need to help make the network increasingly more secure.

For instance, if Alice pays a transaction fee of 0.0001 Ⓝ to contract A, it receives 0.00003 Ⓝ (30% of the fee). If contract A utilizes contract B for 50% of its functionality, both contracts split the reward, each receiving 0.000015 Ⓝ. This incentivizes developers to create popular libraries that can benefit from usage fees. The funds can be utilized for various purposes, such as increasing storage, managed by a DAO, or implementing token buy-back and burn strategies.\n\n**Account Name System**: NEAR features human-readable account names, enhancing user experience. Account names are categorized by length: shorter names (less than 32 characters) are expected to be more valuable and will be auctioned post MainNet launch. The auction process involves bids that mask the bid amount and lasts for seven days, with a second-price auction system. The proceeds from these auctions are burned, benefiting token holders.\n\n**Economic Alignment**: NEAR Protocol aims to align the interests of users, developers, validators, and token holders within its ecosystem. Users seek security, developers aim for adoption and revenue, validators want higher income, and token holders desire long-term value retention. As the ecosystem grows, the demand for tokens increases, leading to greater validator income through reduced supply from staking, transaction fee burning, and state staking. This facilitates a secure environment for users while attracting developers to build on the platform.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe NEAR Protocol's design promotes a balanced utility between users, developers, and validators, fostering a secure and growing ecosystem through aligned incentives and increased demand for the NEAR token."}]}

Let's break down the key components of this part of the documentation for clarity:\n\n### Overview of Access Keys\n\nIn NEAR Protocol, access keys are used to authorize transactions and operations for an account. Each access key can have different permissions, such as \"full access\" or \"function call\" permissions. In this snippet, twelve access keys are listed, all of which are granted \"full access\" to the account. \n\n### Structure of the Access Key Information\n\nFor each access key, the output provides:\n\n1. **Key Type**: Each key is of type `ed25519`, which is a widely used public-key signature system.\n2. **Public Key**: This is the public portion of the key pair. For example, `ed25519:5UJE4PzyxECS42hBZSD1QQCLdq5j39vCtzshFPbnGdm1`.\n3. **Nonce**: This is a unique number that is incremented with each transaction sent from this key. It helps to prevent replay attacks. For instance, in the first access key, the nonce is `73069087000001`.\n4. **Access Level**: This shows the level of access granted by the key. In this case, all keys are granted \"full access,\" which means they can perform any action on behalf of the account.\n\n### Example Breakdown\n\nHere's a breakdown of the first access key for better understanding:\n\n- **Access Key**: `ed25519:5UJE4PzyxECS42hBZSD1QQCLdq5j39vCtzshFPbnGdm1`\n  - **Type**: `ed25519`\n  - **Nonce**: `73069087000001`\n  - **Access Level**: \"full access\"\n\nThis means that the key can be used to perform any action on the account without restrictions.\n\n### Demonstration of Command\n\nThe subsequent command demonstrates how to view an account summary for a specific NEAR account (`fro_volod.testnet`) at a specified block hash. The command is structured as follows:\n\n```bash\nnear account \\\n    view-account-summary fro_volod.testnet \\\n    network-config testnet \\\n    at-block-hash HCUJq3vQ3ztyCZAhmRmHR3cwSDcoE4zEbaWkhAjFuxUY\n```\n\n- **Command**: `near account view-account-summary`\n- **Account**: `fro_volod.testnet` is the account being queried.\n- **Network Configuration**: `testnet` specifies which NEAR network to connect to.\n- **Block Hash**: The `at-block-hash` parameter allows the user to specify a particular block to view the account state at that point in time.\n\n### Result of the Command\n\nThe command's result provides a summary of the account's state at the specified block:\n\n- **Account Balance**: Displays the native NEAR balance of the account.\n- **Validator Stake**: Shows how much NEAR is staked with a validator (if any).\n- **Storage Used**: Indicates the amount of storage utilized by the account.\n- **Contract Code Checksum**: Provides a SHA-256 checksum of the contract code associated with the account, which can be useful for verifying integrity.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis section of the documentation is helpful for developers who need to manage access keys and understand account states on the NEAR Protocol. It provides essential information on how to view access keys, their permissions, and the current state of an account at a specific block in the blockchain. Understanding these components is crucial for securely managing accounts and ensuring appropriate access levels in decentralized applications on the NEAR platform."}]}

Next.js is a popular React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation among other features. Here's a breakdown of the code:\n\n```javascript\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\n```\n- This line is a TypeScript JSDoc annotation that specifies the type of the `nextConfig` variable. It imports the `NextConfig` type from the `next` module. This helps with type checking and provides IntelliSense support in editors that support TypeScript.\n\n```javascript\nconst nextConfig = {\n  reactStrictMode: true,\n};\n```\n- Here, we define a constant `nextConfig` which is an object that contains the configuration settings for the Next.js application.\n- The property `reactStrictMode: true` enables React's Strict Mode. This is a feature that helps developers identify potential problems in their application by adding additional checks and warnings. It does not affect the production build but is useful during development.\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = nextConfig;\n```\n- This line exports the `nextConfig` object so that it can be used by Next.js when the application starts. By using `module.exports`, we make this configuration available to the rest of the Next.js framework.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, this code snippet configures a Next.js application to use React's Strict Mode during development. This is beneficial for catching potential issues and ensuring that the application adheres to best practices. The use of TypeScript annotations enhances developer experience by providing type safety and autocompletion features. Overall, this configuration serves as a foundational setup for a Next.js project."}]}

Let's break it down step by step to understand what it does and how to print the output to the terminal.\n\n### Code Explanation\n\nThe code is designed to handle relevant outcomes from a stream of events, specifically focusing on minted NFTs. Here’s a breakdown of the critical parts:\n\n1. **Variables Initialization**:\n    ```ts\n    let output = [];\n    ```\n   An empty array `output` is declared to collect results for each relevant outcome processed.\n\n2. **Looping through Relevant Outcomes**:\n    ```ts\n    for (let relevantOutcome of relevantOutcomes) {\n    ```\n   This `for` loop iterates over each `relevantOutcome`, which represents a transaction or event related to NFT minting.\n\n3. **Marketplace Detection**:\n    ```ts\n    if (relevantOutcome.receipt.receiverId.endsWith(\".paras.near\")) {\n        marketplace = \"Paras\";\n    } else if (relevantOutcome.receipt.receiverId.match(/\\.mintbase\\d+\\.near$/)) {\n        marketplace = \"Mintbase\";\n    } else {\n        nfts = relevantOutcome.events.flatMap(event => event.data);\n    }\n    ```\n   The code checks the `receiverId` of the `receipt` to determine which marketplace the NFT was minted on (either Paras or Mintbase). Based on the marketplace, it processes the events differently.\n\n4. **NFT Data Extraction**:\n    ```ts\n    nfts = relevantOutcome.events.flatMap(event => {\n        return (event.data as ParasEventLogData[])\n            .map(eventData => ({\n                owner: eventData.owner_id,\n                links: eventData.token_ids.map(\n                    tokenId => `https://paras.id/token/${relevantOutcome.receipt.receiverId}::${tokenId.split(\":\")[0]}/${tokenId}`\n                )\n            }));\n    });\n    ```\n   For each event, the code extracts NFT data, including the owner and links to the NFT on the respective marketplace.\n\n5. **Storing Results**:\n    ```ts\n    output.push({\n        receiptId: relevantOutcome.receipt.id,\n        marketplace,\n        createdOn,\n        nfts,\n    });\n    ```\n   Each processed relevant outcome is pushed into the `output` array, which now includes the `receiptId`, the `marketplace`, the `createdOn` date, and the list of NFTs.\n\n6. **Output to Terminal**:\n    ```ts\n    if (output.length) {\n        console.log(`We caught freshly minted NFTs!`);\n        console.dir(output, { depth: 5 });\n    }\n    ```\n   If there are any entries in `output`, a message is printed to the terminal along with the detailed structure of `output`, showing the minted NFTs.\n\n### Final Code\n\nHere’s how the relevant parts of the code come together in `index.ts`:\n\n```ts\n// Assuming this is part of the handleStreamerMessage function\nconst createdOn = new Date(streamerMessage.block.header.timestamp / 1000000); // Convert timestamp to Date\n\nlet output = [];\nfor (let relevantOutcome of relevantOutcomes) {\n    let marketplace = \"Unknown\";\n    let nfts = [];\n\n    // Detecting the marketplace\n    if (relevantOutcome.receipt.receiverId.endsWith(\".paras.near\")) {\n        marketplace = \"Paras\";\n        nfts = relevantOutcome.events.flatMap(event => {\n            return (event.data as ParasEventLogData[])\n                .map(eventData => ({\n                    owner: eventData.owner_id,\n                    links: eventData.token_ids.map(\n                        tokenId => `https://paras.id/token/${relevantOutcome.receipt.receiverId}::${tokenId.split(\":\")[0]}/${tokenId}`\n                    )\n                }));\n        });\n    } else if (relevantOutcome.receipt.receiverId.match(/\\.mintbase\\d+\\.near$/)) {\n        marketplace = \"Mintbase\";\n        nfts = relevantOutcome.events.flatMap(event => {\n            return (event.data as MintbaseEventLogData[])\n                .map(eventData => {\n                    const memo = JSON.parse(eventData.memo);\n                    return {\n                        owner: eventData.owner_id,\n                        links: [`https://mintbase.io/thing/${memo[\"meta_id\"]}:${relevantOutcome.receipt.receiverId}`]\n                    };\n                });\n        });\n    } else {\n        nfts = relevantOutcome.events.flatMap(event => event.data);\n    }\n\n    // Pushing the output\n    output.push({\n        receiptId: relevantOutcome.receipt.id,\n        marketplace,\n        createdOn, // Added createdOn to output\n        nfts,\n    });\n}\n\n// Print output if there are any minted NFTs\nif (output.length) {\n    console.log(`We caught freshly minted NFTs!`);\n    console.dir(output, { depth: 5 });\n}\n\n// Start the indexer\nnpm run start\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis code snippet efficiently processes NFT minting events, categorizes them by marketplace, and constructs a detailed output for each minted NFT.

Below, I'll break down the key components of this code for clarity.\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n#### Logging Transaction Results\n\nThe initial part of the code appears to be a match statement that handles different types of actions or results related to accounts and delegates. Here's a simplified breakdown:\n\n```rust\nAccount { beneficiary_id: _ } => {\n    eprintln!(\n        \"Account <{}> has been successfully deleted.\",\n        transaction_info.transaction.signer_id,\n    );\n}\n```\n- This section checks if the action pertains to an `Account` type where an account has been deleted. \n- It uses `eprintln!` to print an error message to the standard error output. The message indicates the successful deletion of the account, using `transaction_info.transaction.signer_id` to show which account was deleted.\n\n```rust\nnear_primitives::views::ActionView::Delegate {\n    delegate_action,\n    signature: _,\n} => {\n    eprintln!(\n        \"Actions delegated for <{}> completed successfully.\",\n        delegate_action.sender_id,\n    );\n}\n```\n- This part deals with a `Delegate` action, indicating that actions have been successfully delegated.\n- Again, it logs the sender ID of the delegated action, signaling completion.\n\n### Error Handling Function: `rpc_transaction_error`\n\nThe function `rpc_transaction_error` is designed to handle and categorize various transaction-related errors. It takes a reference to a `JsonRpcError`, which can encapsulate different error types. Here’s a breakdown:\n\n```rust\npub fn rpc_transaction_error(\n    err: &near_jsonrpc_client::errors::JsonRpcError<\n        near_jsonrpc_client::methods::broadcast_tx_commit::RpcTransactionError,\n    >,\n) -> color_eyre::Result<String> {\n```\n- The function takes an error type specifically related to JSON RPC, which is a common protocol for interacting with blockchain nodes.\n\n#### Match Statement for Error Types\n\nThe match statements within the function are used to check the type of error and respond appropriately:\n\n```rust\nmatch &err {\n    near_jsonrpc_client::errors::JsonRpcError::TransportError(_rpc_transport_error) => {\n        Ok(\"Transport error transaction\".to_string())\n    }\n}\n```\n- This part checks if the error is a `TransportError`, which generally implies issues with network connectivity. It returns a simple string indicating a transport error.\n\nNext, the function checks for `ServerError`, which can have several variants, including `HandlerError` and `RequestValidationError`. Each variant is matched to provide a specific response:\n\n```rust\nnear_jsonrpc_client::errors::JsonRpcError::ServerError(rpc_server_error) => match rpc_server_error {\n    near_jsonrpc_client::errors::JsonRpcServerError::HandlerError(rpc_transaction_error) => match rpc_transaction_error {\n        near_jsonrpc_client::methods::broadcast_tx_commit::RpcTransactionError::TimeoutError => {\n            Ok(\"Timeout error transaction\".to_string())\n        }\n        // Additional error cases...\n    }\n}\n```\n- Each error case provides a meaningful message or indicates a specific error condition, such as `TimeoutError`, `InvalidTransaction`, or `InternalError`.\n\n### Error Conversion Function: `convert_action_error_to_cli_result`\n\nFollowing the `rpc_transaction_error` function, there's an indication of another function that converts action errors to a CLI result:\n\n```rust\npub fn convert_action_error_to_cli_result(\n    action_error: &near_primitives::errors::ActionError,\n) -> crate::CliResult {\n```\n- The purpose of this function is to handle different types of action errors that may arise during transactions or actions on the blockchain.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis code snippet illustrates how the NEAR Protocol handles logging and error reporting for account actions and transaction errors. It uses Rust's powerful pattern matching to differentiate between various error types and log appropriate messages or return user-friendly descriptions of errors. The focus on structured error handling and user feedback is crucial for creating a robust and user-friendly blockchain interface."}]}

which is a standard for remote procedure calls using JSON.\n- **Transaction Information**: The transaction details include the sender, receiver, actions (in this case, a transfer of NEAR tokens), and the transaction status.\n- **Execution Outcome**: The `transaction_outcome` and `receipts_outcome` provide detailed information about the transaction's execution and any receipts generated.\n- **Gas and Tokens Burnt**: These fields indicate the cost associated with the transaction and its receipts, which is crucial for understanding the resource usage on the NEAR blockchain.\n\n### What Could Go Wrong?\nThe snippet also includes a mention of potential errors that can occur when the API request fails. The RPC server returns structured error responses that allow developers to handle errors systematically. The error response follows a convention that defines the error type, cause, and additional data, which is essential for debugging and ensuring robust client-side error handling. \n\nThis structured approach to error reporting helps developers anticipate and manage various failure scenarios effectively, improving the overall reliability of applications built on the NEAR Protocol."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the following section of a NEAR Protocol article:\n and Account primitives in the same shared data pool makes it trivially simple to create seamless interactions between those elements in ways which are almost impossible outside of the digitally native medium. The most commonly cited use case involves permissionless peer-to-peer transfer of money but this applies more broadly to any kind of digital asset. Transaction primitives include: Direct: Transfers can be made directly between accounts without requiring the code or permission of a specific application, allowing peer-to-peer marketplaces or transfers. Instant: Financial and digital-good transactions have finality in seconds and do not require long waiting periods for confirmation. Micro: Negligible fees make high frequency or small quantity transfers significantly more viable than current financial infrastructure allows. Conditional: A smart contract can easily add logic to transactions, for example to create conditional escrow or time-based releases of currency or data. Verification Primitives The immutable public ledger used to store data on NEAR creates both a verifiable record of what has occurred in the past and a verifiable repository of the code which is being run behind particular applications. This can be used in a number of creative ways from the small (is a dice game actually using randomness?) to the large (creating audit trails for supply chains). Verification primitives include: Checkpointing: Cryptographic timestamping means it is easy to store verifiable checkpoints of state at a particular time, allowing applications to verify the authenticity or occurence of previous activity. Verify Process Integrity: The code which runs apps deployed to the platform can be verified in a way that current server-side code cannot. Combinatorial Primitives While it isn’t hard to examine the low-level primitives which are natively provided by the technology of the platform, perhaps the most exciting possibilities come from combining multiple primitives to create higher level primitives. While many of these will be discovered over time, some examples include: Permissionless Markets: Most markets today require permission from someone in order to function, for example the provider of the marketplace where activity occurs. The combination of multiple low-level primitives disintermediates this control and allows permissionless markets to flourish in places where there was no room to operate previously. This requires the combination of: A native medium of exchange (to transact in) and unit of account (to price in). Note that dynamic cross-currency conversion can make this easier across currencies but users generally still prefer to have a single schelling point currency. Verifiable ownership of an asset Peer-to-peer/permissionless transfer of the asset A censorship-resistant marketplace application (which provides discoverability, matching and pricing) Derivative Assets: While it’s significant to provide censorship-resistant asset storage in the first place, combining multiple low-level primitives allows us to create an infinite variety of new assets which combine existing assets, transactions and logic to meet the risk management needs of anyone so inclined to use them. This requires the combination of: Verifiable ownership of an asset Programmatic escrow of an asset Programmatic rights transfer Open State Components: Any app has access (when granted) to the shared pool of state data, whether in regards to specific assets or users of the platform. This allows components to operate as microservices do in today’s applications — performing specific functions that can be composed together to achieve larger business goals. Because they are public, competition will ensure that the best of these achieve usage. This requires the combination of: A shared data pool User-sovereign data Verifiable process integrity Section 10 The Future 01. Abstract 02. Introduction 03. Why NEAR? 04. Design Principles 05. How NEAR Works 06. Economics 07. Technology 08. Governance 09. Primitives 10. The Future 11. Disclaimer Glossary of Terms The future, like the Internet itself, is infinitely configurable. We don’t know what it will look like but we can both identify some of the key forces which will govern its path and predict some of the major tools that will take us there. Privacy: By default, activity and data on the blockchain is done in plain sight. The essence of privacy, however, is choice — whether their activity should be made transparent or hidden from view. Though the default technical tooling doesn’t provide this privacy protection, a number of solutions applied on top of it make this possible. In the weak form, data can be encrypted before writing to the chain. This generally protects the integrity of the data itself but still leaves transactions vulnerable to tracking and good analysis can often piece together what actually occurred. Thus new technologies like zero knowledge proofs hold an interesting opportunity to make not just data private but also the very computations that modify it. This technology isn’t baked into the NEAR platform day 1 but, should the community drive for it, it is possible to implement. Private Shards: Not all blockchain use cases demand the full security and protection of the public chain for each transaction. Sometimes a consortium of users or even a single entity would prefer to run their own chain, where they control"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The section discusses the capabilities of NEAR Protocol's account and transaction primitives, emphasizing how they facilitate seamless interactions between digital assets.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain the following code snippet from NEAR repository file `docs/1.concepts/basics/validators.md`:\n```---\nid: validators\ntitle: Validators\n---\n\nThe NEAR network is decentralized, meaning that multiple people collaborate in order to keep it safe. We call such people **validators**.\n\nIn order to make sure that all the transactions in the network are valid, i.e. that nobody is trying to steal money, the validators follow a specific consensus\nmechanism.\n\nCurrently, there are a few well-known consensus mechanisms to keep a blockchain working correctly and resistant to attacks.\nNEAR Protocol uses a version of **Proof-of-Stake**, particularly [Thresholded Proof of Stake](https://near.org/blog/thresholded-proof-of-stake/).\n\nIn Proof-of-Stake, users show support to specific network validators by delegating NEAR tokens to them. This process is known as **staking**. The main idea is that, if a validator has a large amount of tokens delegated is because the community trusts them.\n\n### Securing the Network\nValidators have two main jobs. The first is to validate and execute transactions, aggregating them in the blocks that form the blockchain. Their second job is to oversee other validators, making sure no one produces an invalid block or creates an alternative chain (eg. with the goal of creating a double spend).\n\nIf a validator is caught misbehaving, then they get \"slashed\", meaning that their stake (or part of it) is burned.\n\nIn the NEAR networks, an attempt to manipulate the chain would mean taking control over the majority of the validators at once, so that the malicious activity won't be flagged. However, this would require putting a huge sum of capital at risk, since an unsuccessful attack would mean slashing your staked tokens.\n\n### Validator's Economy\nIn exchange for servicing the network, validators are rewarded with a target number of NEAR every epoch. The target value is computed in such a way that, on an annualized basis, it will be 4.5% of the total supply.\n\nAll transaction fees (minus the part which is allocated as the rebate for contracts) which are collected within each epoch are burned by the system. The inflationary reward is paid out to validators at the same rate regardless of the number of fees collected or burned. \n\n\n## Intro to Validators\n\n[Validators](https://pages.near.org/papers/the-official-near-white-paper/#economics) are responsible for producing blocks and the security of the network.\n\nSince Validators validate all shards, high requirements are set for running them (an 8-Core CPU with 16GB of RAM and 1 TB SSD of storage). The cost of running a block-producing validator node is estimated to be $330 per month for hosting. Please see our [hardware and cost estimates page](https://near-nodes.io/validator/hardware) for more info.\n\nThe current active Validators are available on the Explorer. The minimum seat price to become a block-producing validator is based on the 300th proposal. (If more than 300 proposals are submitted, the threshold will simply be the stake of the 300th proposal, provided that it’s larger than the minimum threshold of 25,500 $NEAR.) The current seat price to become a block-producing validator is updated live on the Explorer. Any validator nodes with stakes higher than the seat price can join the active set of Validators.\n\n<blockquote className=\"lesson\">\n<strong>Is there a plan to support GPU compute if certain validator nodes can offer that or is it just CPU?</strong><br /><br />\n  \nWe don't need GPU support as we are a POS chain and we require very little compute power.\n\nYou can read more about our consensus strategy on our <a href=\"https://github.com/near/wiki/blob/master/Archive/validators/about.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Validator Quickstart</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/near/wiki/blob/master/Archive/validators/faq.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Staking FA</a>.\n</blockquote>\n\n## Chunk-Only Validators\n\nThe Chunk-Only Producer is a more accessible role with lower hardware and token requirements. This new role will allow the network's validator number to grow, creating more opportunities to earn rewards and secure the NEAR Ecosystem. \n\n[Chunk-Only Producers](https://pages.near.org/papers/the-official-near-white-paper/#economics) are solely responsible for [producing chunks](https://pages.near.org/papers/nightshade/#nightshade) (parts of the block from a shard, see [Nightshade](https://near.org/papers/nightshade/) for more detail) in one shard (a partition on the network). Because Chunk-Only Producers only need to validate one shard, they can run the validator node on a 8-Core CPU, with 16GB of RAM, and 500 GB SSD of storage.\n\nLike Validators, Chunk-Only Producers will```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This code snippet is a markdown document that provides an overview of validators in the NEAR Protocol ecosystem. Here’s a detailed breakdown of its components, structure, and key concepts:\n\n### Structure and Content Overview\n\n1. **Document Metadata**:\n   ```markdown\n   ---\n   id: validators\n   title: Validators\n   ---\n   ```\n   - This section defines the document's metadata. The `id` serves as a unique identifier, and the `title` specifies what the document is about.\n\n2. **Introduction to Validators**:\n   - The document explains the concept of validators in the NEAR network, emphasizing that the network is decentralized and relies on these validators to maintain security and transaction integrity.\n\n3. **Consensus Mechanism**:\n   - NEAR Protocol utilizes a variant of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) called **Thresholded Proof of Stake**. This is significant as it determines how validators are chosen and how they maintain the network's security.\n   - In PoS, users can delegate their NEAR tokens to validators as a form of support, known as **staking**.\n\n4. **Roles and Responsibilities**:\n   - Validators have two primary responsibilities:\n     - Validate and execute transactions, forming blocks in the blockchain.\n     - Monitor other validators to ensure that they do not produce invalid blocks (which could lead to issues like double spending).\n   - If a validator is found to be acting maliciously, they face **slashing**, which means losing part or all of their stake as a penalty.\n\n5. **Security Considerations**:\n   - It discusses the security model where attacking the network would require controlling a majority of the validators, which is risky due to the potential for slashing.\n\n6. **Validator Economics**:\n   - Validators earn NEAR tokens as a reward for their services, with a target annualized return of 4.5% of the total supply.\n   - The document explains how transaction fees are handled, noting that fees collected are burned to manage inflation, while validator rewards remain consistent regardless of fee income.\n\n7. **Validator Requirements**:\n   - It specifies the hardware requirements for running a validator node, emphasizing the need for a powerful setup (8-Core CPU, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD).\n   - It also mentions the estimated monthly cost of running a validator node and provides links for further details on cost estimates and hardware specifications.\n\n8. **Minimum Seat Price**:\n   - The document outlines how the minimum stake required to become a block-producing validator is determined by the stake of the 300th proposal and the minimum threshold of 25,500 NEAR.\n\n9. **Chunk-Only Validators**:\n   - Introduces a new role called **Chunk-Only Producer**, which has lower hardware requirements and allows more participants to contribute to the network's security.\n   - These producers are responsible for producing chunks from a shard, simplifying the role and reducing the barrier to entry.\n\n10. **Additional Resources**:\n    - The document includes references to external resources for further reading, such as links to the official NEAR white paper and FAQs related to validators.\n\n### Key Concepts Explained\n\n- **Validators**: Nodes that validate transactions and maintain the blockchain's integrity. They require a significant amount of NEAR tokens delegated to them as a signal of trust from the community.\n  \n- **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)**: A consensus mechanism where validators are chosen based on the number of tokens they hold and are willing to lock up as stake.\n\n- **Slashing**: A penalty mechanism for misbehaving validators, which helps deter dishonest actions.\n\n- **Reward Structure**: Validators receive rewards and must maintain their operations economically viable while ensuring the network's security.\n\n- **Chunk-Only Producers**: A role designed to increase network participation by lowering the hardware and staking requirements, thus enhancing scalability and security.\n\nThis document serves as an informative guide for developers and participants in the NEAR ecosystem, outlining the critical functions and responsibilities of validators, the economic model, and the technical requirements for participation in the network."}]}

Below, I will break down the key components of the code and explain their functionality.\n\n### Overview of the Code Snippet\n\n1. **Creating a Drop**: This section shows how to invoke the `create_drop` method, passing the necessary parameters to create a drop of fungible tokens (FTs).\n2. **Transferring FTs**: After creating a drop, this part demonstrates how to transfer FTs to the linkdrop contract.\n\n### Detailed Explanation\n\n#### 1. Creating a Drop\n\nThis part of the code demonstrates how to call the `create_drop` method on the `keypomContract`. \n\n```javascript\nconst keypomContract = \"v2.keypom.near\"; // The contract address for the keypom linkdrop\nconst ftContract = \"ft.primitives.near\"; // The contract address for the fungible token\nconst dropAmount = \"10000000000000000000000\"; // Amount of FT to be available per drop\n\n// Call the create_drop method\nNear.call([\n  {\n    contractName: keypomContract, // Contract to call\n    methodName: \"create_drop\", // Method to invoke\n    args: {\n      public_keys: state.publicKeys, // List of public keys to drop tokens to\n      deposit_per_use: dropAmount, // Amount of FT per use\n      ftData: {\n        contractId: ftContract, // FT contract ID\n        senderId: accountId, // Sender's account ID\n        amount: \"1\" // Amount of FTs per use (human-readable)\n        // Alternatively, absoluteAmount can be used depending on decimals of the FT\n      },\n    },\n    deposit: \"23000000000000000000000\", // Total deposit required for the drop\n    gas: \"100000000000000\" // Gas limit for the transaction\n  },\n]);\n```\n\n**Key Points**:\n- **public_keys**: An array of public keys that will receive the fungible tokens.\n- **deposit_per_use**: The amount of tokens that will be used for each drop.\n- **ftData**: Contains the details about the fungible token, including:\n  - `contractId`: The contract address of the FT.\n  - `senderId`: The account from which the tokens are sent.\n  - `amount`: The number of tokens each recipient will receive.\n- **deposit**: The total amount of yoctoNEAR required to execute the transaction (covers the costs of the drop).\n- **gas**: The amount of gas allocated for the execution of the transaction.\n\n#### 2. Transferring FTs\n\nAfter creating a drop, you need to transfer tokens to the linkdrop contract.\n\n```javascript\nNear.call([\n  {\n    contractName: ftContract, // FT contract to call\n    methodName: \"ft_transfer\", // The method to transfer FTs\n    args: {\n      receiver_id: keypomContract, // The keypom contract address\n      amount: \"1\", // Amount of FTs to transfer\n    },\n    deposit: \"1\", // Small deposit for the transfer\n    gas: \"300000000000000\", // Gas limit for the transfer\n  },\n]);\n```\n\n**Key Points**:\n- **ft_transfer**: The method used to transfer fungible tokens from one account to another.\n- **receiver_id**: The account that will receive the tokens (in this case, the linkdrop contract).\n- **amount**: Specifies how many FTs to transfer.\n- **deposit**: A nominal deposit to cover transaction costs.\n- **gas**: The amount of gas allocated for this transfer.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis code snippet illustrates the process of creating a fungible token drop and transferring tokens to the linkdrop contract on the NEAR Protocol. Each code segment is designed to facilitate the interaction between different smart contracts using NEAR's contract call functionality. By following the outlined steps, developers can implement a token drop mechanism in their dApps effectively."}]}

If the transport is not connected, it throws an error indicating that the device is not connected.\n\n3. **Device State Reset**:\n   - The method `this.getVersion()` is called to reset the device's state. This is crucial to ensure that any previous operations do not affect the current signing operation.\n\n4. **Data Preparation**:\n   - The `CHUNK_SIZE` variable is defined to limit how much data is sent to the device at once. This is set to 123 bytes, allowing for 5 additional service bytes needed by the protocol.\n   - The `allData` variable combines the parsed derivation path and the data to be signed into a single `Buffer`.\n\n5. **Chunked Data Transmission**:\n   - A `for` loop iterates over `allData`, sending it in chunks defined by `CHUNK_SIZE`.\n   - The variable `isLastChunk` is determined to check if the current chunk is the last one to be sent.\n\n6. **Sending Data**:\n   - The `this.transport.send()` method sends the chunk to the hardware device. It includes:\n     - `CLA`: Class byte for the command.\n     - `INS_SIGN`: Instruction byte indicating the operation is a signing operation.\n     - `P1_LAST` or `P1_MORE`: Indicates if more chunks will follow.\n     - `P2_IGNORE`: Currently unused additional parameters.\n     - The current chunk of data.\n\n7. **Response Handling**:\n   - If the current chunk is the last one, the function returns the response, excluding the last two bytes that typically represent status information.\n\n8. **Error Handling**:\n   - If the function completes the loop without finding valid data to sign, it throws an error stating \"Invalid data or derivation path\".\n\n### Summary\nThis code snippet efficiently handles the signing of data by chunking it and communicating with a hardware wallet. It ensures that the device is connected, resets its state, prepares the data, and sends it in manageable chunks while providing error handling for robustness. This approach is particularly important when working with devices that may have strict input limits or require specific protocols for communication."}]}

Let's break down the provided code snippet from the NEAR Protocol repository, specifically from the `non-fungible-token-receiver.js` file. This code defines a smart contract that handles the reception of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n```javascript\nimport { NearBindgen, call, near, assert, initialize } from \"near-sdk-js\";\n```\n- This line imports necessary decorators and functions from the `near-sdk-js` library. These utilities help in building the smart contract in a structured way.\n  - `NearBindgen`: A decorator to define a NEAR smart contract.\n  - `call`: A decorator to define callable methods in the contract.\n  - `near`: A module providing access to NEAR-specific functionalities like logging and account information.\n  - `assert`: A utility function to assert conditions and throw errors if they are not met.\n  - `initialize`: A decorator for the initialization method of the contract.\n\n```javascript\n@NearBindgen({ requireInit: true })\nexport class NftContract {\n  constructor() {\n    this.nonFungibleTokenAccountId = \"\";\n  }\n```\n- The `NftContract` class is decorated with `@NearBindgen`, indicating that it is a smart contract. The `requireInit: true` option specifies that the contract must be initialized before it can be used.\n- The constructor initializes the `nonFungibleTokenAccountId` variable, which will store the account ID of the non-fungible token contract.\n\n```javascript\n  @initialize({})\n  init({ nonFungibleTokenAccountId }) {\n    this.nonFungibleTokenAccountId = nonFungibleTokenAccountId;\n  }\n```\n- The `init` method, decorated with `@initialize`, is called once when the contract is deployed. It accepts an object containing the `nonFungibleTokenAccountId` and assigns it to the class property.\n\n```javascript\n  @call({})\n  nftOnTransfer({ senderId, previousOwnerId, tokenId, msg }) {\n```\n- The `nftOnTransfer` method is defined with the `@call` decorator, indicating that it can be called externally. This method is triggered when an NFT is transferred to this contract.\n- The method takes an object with the following parameters:\n  - `senderId`: The account ID of the account sending the NFT.\n  - `previousOwnerId`: The previous owner of the NFT.\n  - `tokenId`: The unique identifier of the NFT being transferred.\n  - `msg`: An optional message that provides context for the transfer.\n\n```javascript\n    near.log(\n      `nftOnTransfer called, params: senderId: ${senderId}, previousOwnerId: ${previousOwnerId}, tokenId: ${tokenId}, msg: ${msg}`\n    );\n```\n- This line logs the parameters received by the `nftOnTransfer` method for debugging purposes.\n\n```javascript\n    assert(\n      near.predecessorAccountId() === this.nonFungibleTokenAccountId,\n      \"Only supports the one non-fungible token contract\"\n    );\n```\n- Here, an assertion is made to ensure that the caller of this method (the account that initiated the transfer) is the non-fungible token contract specified during initialization. If the assertion fails, an error message is provided.\n\n```javascript\n    if (msg === \"return-it-now\") {\n      near.log(`Returning ${tokenId} to ${senderId}`);\n      return false;\n    } else if (msg === \"keep-it-now\") {\n      near.log(`Keep ${tokenId}`);\n      return true;\n    } else {\n      throw Error(\"unsupported msg\");\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n- The method checks the value of `msg`:\n  - If `msg` is \"return-it-now\", it logs a message indicating that the NFT will be returned to the sender and returns `false`.\n  - If `msg` is \"keep-it-now\", it logs a message indicating that the NFT will be kept and returns `true`.\n  - If `msg` does not match either of the expected values, an error is thrown indicating that the message is unsupported.\n\n### Summary\nThis smart contract serves as a receiver for non-fungible tokens. It requires initialization with a specific non-fungible token contract account ID and handles token transfers based on the provided message. The contract can either return the token to the sender or allow it to be kept, depending on the message received. Proper assertions and logging are included to ensure the contract behaves as expected and to facilitate debugging."}]}

The `TreeMap` is a key-value store that maintains the order of keys, which is important for efficient data retrieval and manipulation. Here’s a breakdown of the code:\n\n### Key Components Explained\n\n1. **Imports**:\n   - `near_sdk_macros::near`: Likely used for NEAR-specific macros.\n   - `std::ops::Bound`, `std::vec::Vec`, `std::{borrow::Borrow, iter::FusedIterator}`: Standard library components for handling collections and iterators.\n   - `borsh::{BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize}`: Borsh is a serialization format used in NEAR for efficient data storage and transmission.\n\n2. **Trait Implementations**:\n   - The code implements the `IntoIterator` trait for both immutable (`&'a TreeMap<K, V, H>`) and mutable (`&'a mut TreeMap<K, V, H>`) references of `TreeMap`.\n   - The `IntoIterator` trait allows instances of `TreeMap` to be converted into iterators, enabling easy iteration over key-value pairs.\n\n3. **Iterator Struct**:\n   - The `Iter` struct is defined, which holds references to the keys and values of the `TreeMap`. It is parameterized by the types of keys (`K`), values (`V`), and the hashing mechanism (`H`).\n   - The `new` method initializes the iterator, creating a new instance of `Iter` that has access to the keys and values of the `TreeMap`.\n\n4. **Iterator Methods**:\n   - The `Iterator` trait is implemented for the `Iter` struct, providing methods like `next`, `nth`, `size_hint`, and `count`:\n     - **`next`**: Retrieves the next item in the iterator.\n     - **`nth`**: Returns the nth item in the iterator, using the underlying keys to find the corresponding value.\n     - **`size_hint`**: Provides an estimate of the remaining elements.\n     - **`count`**: Returns the total number of items in the iterator.\n\n5. **ExactSizeIterator and FusedIterator**:\n   - These traits are implemented for `Iter`, indicating that the iterator has a known size and can be fused (i.e., once it is exhausted, subsequent calls to `next` will return `None` without any additional computation).\n\n6. **DoubleEndedIterator**:\n   - This trait allows iteration from both ends of the collection, providing methods `next_back` and `nth_back`:\n     - **`next_back`**: Gets the last item of the iterator.\n     - **`nth_back`**: Retrieves the nth item from the end of the iterator.\n\n7. **Function `get_entry_mut`**:\n   - This function is partially shown at the end. It is designed to get a mutable reference to a value in the `LookupMap` based on a key. The function signature indicates it expects a mutable reference to a `LookupMap` and a reference to a key.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe code defines a robust iterator for the `TreeMap` structure in NEAR's SDK, enabling developers to efficiently traverse key-value pairs in a sorted order. The iterator supports both mutable and immutable access, is compatible with various iterator traits (like `ExactSizeIterator`, `FusedIterator`, and `DoubleEndedIterator`), and uses Borsh for serialization, which is crucial for blockchain applications. This implementation is optimal for scenarios where ordered key-value access is necessary, such as state management in smart contracts. \n\nThis design pattern enhances usability and performance when working with collections in NEAR, providing a familiar interface for Rust developers."}]}

This implementation includes methods for managing the tree structure, with a focus on maintaining balance during insertions and deletions. Let's break down the critical components of the code snippet:\n\n### Key Functions and Logic\n\n1. **Handling Imbalance**:\n   ```rust\n   } else if balance < -1 {\n       let mut rgt = node.rgt.and_then(|id| self.node(id)).unwrap();\n       if self.get_balance(&rgt) > 0 {\n           let rotated = self.rotate_left(&mut rgt);\n           node.rgt = Some(rotated);\n       }\n       self.rotate_right(node)\n   } else {\n       node.id\n   }\n   ```\n   - This checks if the tree is unbalanced, specifically if the balance factor is less than -1. In a balanced binary search tree, a balance factor is calculated as the height difference between the left and right subtrees.\n   - If the right subtree's balance is positive (indicating a left-heavy subtree), it performs a left rotation on the right child before a right rotation on the current node. This helps to maintain the balance of the tree.\n\n2. **Lookup Functionality**:\n   ```rust\n   fn lookup_at(&self, mut at: u64, key: &K) -> Option<(Node<K>, Node<K>)> {\n       let mut p: Node<K> = self.node(at).unwrap();\n       while let Some(node) = self.node(at) {\n           if node.key.eq(key) {\n               return Some((node, p));\n           } else if node.key.lt(key) {\n               match node.rgt {\n                   Some(rgt) => {\n                       p = node;\n                       at = rgt;\n                   }\n                   None => break,\n               }\n           } else {\n               match node.lft {\n                   Some(lft) => {\n                       p = node;\n                       at = lft;\n                   }\n                   None => break,\n               }\n           }\n       }\n       None\n   }\n   ```\n   - This function traverses the tree to find a node holding a specific key. It returns both the found node and its parent node.\n   - The traversal proceeds by comparing the key with the current node's key and navigating left or right accordingly.\n\n3. **Balance Checking**:\n   ```rust\n   fn check_balance(&mut self, at: u64, key: &K) -> u64 {\n       match self.node(at) {\n           Some(mut node) => {\n               if !node.key.eq(key) {\n                   if node.key.gt(key) {\n                       if let Some(l) = node.lft {\n                           let id = self.check_balance(l, key);\n                           node.lft = Some(id);\n                       }\n                   } else if let Some(r) = node.rgt {\n                       let id = self.check_balance(r, key);\n                       node.rgt = Some(id);\n                   }\n               }\n               self.update_height(&mut node);\n               self.enforce_balance(&mut node)\n           }\n           None => at,\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n   - This function ensures that the tree remains balanced after a modification. It recursively checks the balance of each node from the specified node up to the root.\n   - It updates the height of the node and checks if balancing is needed by calling `enforce_balance`.\n\n4. **Node Removal**:\n   ```rust\n   fn do_remove(&mut self, key: &K) -> u64 {\n       let (mut r_node, mut p_node) = match self.lookup_at(self.root, key) {\n           Some(x) => x,\n           None => return self.root,\n       };\n       // Handle leaf and non-leaf nodes...\n   }\n   ```\n   - This function is responsible for removing a node with a specific key from the tree.\n   - It first locates the node (and its parent) using `lookup_at`. If the node is not found, it returns the root without any changes.\n   - Then, it checks if the node is a leaf (no children) or if it has children, and processes accordingly. It also manages the necessary updates to maintain the tree's balance after the removal.\n\n### Summary\nThis code is part of a balanced binary search tree implementation, likely an AVL tree or similar structure.

This is useful for reusing context information in different parts of the codebase.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, this code snippet defines a command-line interface for adding access to a NEAR account using a seed phrase, capturing user input and managing context appropriately. It uses the `interactive_clap` library to facilitate interactive command-line input, while also implementing functionality to convert a seed phrase into a public key that can be used for account operations. The design emphasizes modularity and context management, making it easy to integrate into a larger application workflow involving NEAR accounts."}]}

Instead of placing bids in $NEAR tokens, they will be placed in FTs. This may be useful if, for example, an auctioneer wants to keep the bid amounts constant in terms of dollars as an auction is carried out, so bids can be placed in stablecoins such as $USDC. Another use case is if a project like Ref Finance was holding its own auction and wanted the auction to happen in its project's token $REF.\n\n---\n\n## Specifying the FT contract \n\nWe want to only accept bids in one type of fungible token; accepting many different FTs would make the value of each bid difficult to compare.

With fungible tokens, since an account's balance lives on a separate contract, we call the FT contract which then calls the auction contract and transfers tokens. The method on the FT contract to do this is named `ft_transfer_call` and it will always call a method in the target contract named `ft_on_transfer`. Take a look [here](../../2.build/5.primitives/ft.md#attaching-fts-to-a-call) for more information. \n\n![ft_transfer_call-flow](/docs/assets/auction/auction-ft-transfer.png)\n\nThe `ft_on_transfer` method always has the same interface; the FT contract will pass it the `sender`, the `amount` of FTs being sent and a `msg` which can be empty (which it will be here) or it can contain some information needed by the method (if you want to send multiple arguments in msg it is best practice to deliver this in JSON then parse it in the contract).

Below is a breakdown of the key components and concepts presented in the code and documentation.\n\n### Overview\n\nThe document introduces the concept of using fungible tokens (like stablecoins or project-specific tokens) for placing bids in an auction instead of using NEAR tokens. This allows for more flexibility, such as maintaining constant bid values in terms of dollars or allowing bids in a specific project's token.\n\n### Key Sections Explained\n\n1. **Specifying the FT Contract**:\n   - The auction contract will only accept bids in one type of fungible token. This simplifies the comparison of bid values and prevents confusion that might arise if multiple token types were accepted.\n   - The auctioneer can set a starting bid amount, which further customizes the auction.\n\n2. **Accepting Bids in FTs**:\n   - When a user bids with fungible tokens, they must interact with the FT contract first, as the user's balance is managed by that contract.\n   - The process involves calling the `ft_transfer_call` method on the FT contract. This method facilitates the transfer of tokens while also invoking a method on the auction contract.\n   - The `ft_on_transfer` method is called on the auction contract with parameters including the sender's account ID, the amount of FTs transferred, and an optional message.\n\n   ![Transfer Call Flow](https://docs/assets/auction/auction-ft-transfer.png)  \n   This diagram illustrates the flow of the `ft_transfer_call`.\n\n3. **Method Interface**:\n   - The `ft_on_transfer` method has a standard interface: it receives `sender`, `amount`, and `msg`. \n   - The method must return the number of tokens to be refunded. In this case, all tokens provided in the bid will be used unless the contract encounters an error (in which case the user will be refunded).\n\n4. **Validation of Token Usage**:\n   - When the auction contract is called, it must confirm that the tokens attached are indeed fungible tokens and that they come from the correct FT contract.\n   - This is done by checking the `predecessor` account ID, which will be the FT contract's account ID when the `ft_on_transfer` method is invoked.\n\n### Code Tabs\n\nThe documentation includes code snippets for both JavaScript and Rust implementations, which are accessible through tabs. This allows developers to see the relevant code for the specified language, ensuring they can implement the functionality in their preferred programming language.\n\n#### Example Code Snippet (JavaScript)\n\n```javascript\n// Ensure that the call is coming from the expected FT contract\nassert(\n    context.predecessor === ftContractId,\n    \"Bids must be placed with the specified fungible token.\"\n);\n\n// Process bids and handle token transfers here\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis documentation serves as a guide for developers looking to implement fungible token bidding in an auction smart contract on the NEAR Protocol. By following the outlined steps and using the example code, developers can ensure their auction contracts are capable of handling bids with fungible tokens effectively while maintaining clarity and security."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain the following code snippet from NEAR repository file `docs/3.tutorials/nfts/js/4-core.md`:\n```---\nid: core\ntitle: Core\nsidebar_label: Core\n---\nimport {Github} from \"@site/src/components/codetabs\";\nimport Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';\nimport TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';\n\nIn this tutorial you'll learn how to implement the [core standards](https://nomicon.io/Standards/Tokens/NonFungibleToken/Core) into your smart contract. If you're joining us for the first time, feel free to clone [this repo](https://github.com/near-examples/nft-tutorial) and checkout the `3.enumeration` branch to follow along.\n\n\n```bash\ngit checkout 3.enumeration\n```\n\n:::tip\nIf you wish to see the finished code for this _Core_ tutorial, you can find it on the `4.core` branch.\n:::\n\n## Introduction {#introduction}\n\nUp until this point, you've created a simple NFT smart contract that allows users to mint tokens and view information using the [enumeration standards](https://nomicon.io/Standards/Tokens/NonFungibleToken/Enumeration). Today, you'll expand your smart contract to allow for users to not only mint tokens, but transfer them as well.\n\nAs we did in the [minting tutorial](/tutorials/nfts/js/minting), let's break down the problem into multiple subtasks to make our lives easier. When a token is minted, information is stored in 3 places:\n\n- **tokensPerOwner**: set of tokens for each account.\n- **tokensById**: maps a token ID to a `Token` object.\n- **tokenMetadataById**: maps a token ID to its metadata.\n\nLet's now consider the following scenario. If Benji owns token A and wants to transfer it to Mike as a birthday gift, what should happen? First of all, token A should be removed from Benji's set of tokens and added to Mike's set of tokens.\n\nIf that's the only logic you implement, you'll run into some problems. If you were to do a `view` call to query for information about that token after it's been transferred to Mike, it would still say that Benji is the owner.\n\nThis is because the contract is still mapping the token ID to the old `Token` object that contains the `owner_id` field set to Benji's account ID. You still have to change the `tokensById` data structure so that the token ID maps to a new `Token` object which has Mike as the owner.\n\nWith that being said, the final process for when an owner transfers a token to a receiver should be the following:\n\n- Remove the token from the owner's set.\n- Add the token to the receiver's set.\n- Map a token ID to a new `Token` object containing the correct owner.\n\n:::note\nYou might be curious as to why we don't edit the `tokenMetadataById` field. This is because no matter who owns the token, the token ID will always map to the same metadata. The metadata should never change and so we can just leave it alone.\n:::\n\nAt this point, you're ready to move on and make the necessary modifications to your smart contract.\n\n## Modifications to the contract\n\nLet's start our journey in the `nft-contract/src/nft_core.ts` file.\n\n### Transfer function {#transfer-function}\n\nYou'll start by implementing the `nft_transfer` logic. This function will transfer the specified `token_id` to the `receiver_id` with an optional `memo` such as `\"Happy Birthday Mike!\"`. The core logic will be found in the `internalNftTransfer` function.\n\n<Github language=\"js\" start=\"37\" end=\"64\" url=\"https://github.com/near-examples/nft-tutorial-js/blob/4.core/src/nft-contract/nft_core.ts\" />\n\nThere are a couple things to notice here. Firstly, we've introduced a new function called `assertOneYocto()`. This method will ensure that the user has attached exactly one yoctoNEAR to the call. If a function requires a deposit, you need a full access key to sign that transaction. By adding the one yoctoNEAR deposit requirement, you're essentially forcing the user to sign the transaction with a full access key.\n\nSince the transfer function is potentially transferring very valuable assets, you'll want to make sure that whoever is calling the function has a full access key.\n\nSecondly, we've introduced an `internalTransfer` method. This will perform all the logic necessary to transfer an NFT.\n\n### Internal helper functions\n\nLet's quickly move over to the `nft-contract/src/internal.ts` file so that you can implement the `assertOneYocto()` and `internalTransfer` methods.\n\nLet's start with the easier one, `assertOneYocto```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The provided code snippet is part of a tutorial for implementing core standards of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the NEAR Protocol.

This includes the unique identifier (`id`), the title of the tutorial (`title`), and how it should appear in the sidebar (`sidebar_label`).\n\n2. **Imports**:\n    ```javascript\n    import {Github} from \"@site/src/components/codetabs\";\n    import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';\n    import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';\n    ```\n    These imports bring in components for rendering code tabs and possibly GitHub links in the documentation, enhancing the instructional layout of the tutorial.\n\n3. **Tutorial Introduction**:\n    ```markdown\n    In this tutorial you'll learn how to implement the [core standards](https://nomicon.io/Standards/Tokens/NonFungibleToken/Core) into your smart contract...\n    ```\n    This section provides context for the tutorial, indicating that it will build upon previous work related to NFT enumeration and will introduce the core functionality needed to transfer NFTs.\n\n4. **Git Checkout Command**:\n    ```bash\n    git checkout 3.enumeration\n    ```\n    This command instructs users to switch to a specific branch of the repository that contains the code relevant to the enumeration standards.\n\n5. **Tip and Note Sections**:\n    ```markdown\n    :::tip\n    If you wish to see the finished code for this _Core_ tutorial, you can find it on the `4.core` branch.\n    :::\n    ```\n    The `:::tip` and `:::note` blocks provide helpful hints and clarifications regarding the tutorial content, encouraging users to explore the finished code and explaining why certain data structures are not modified during the transfer operation.\n\n### Key Concepts Explained\n\n- **State Management**:\n    The tutorial explains how when a token is transferred, it must be removed from the owner's list and added to the receiver's list. Additionally, the token's metadata must be updated to reflect the new owner. This is critical to maintaining accurate state within the smart contract.\n\n- **Data Structures**:\n    The code snippet mentions three key data structures:\n    - `tokensPerOwner`: Keeps track of which tokens are owned by which accounts.\n    - `tokensById`: Maps each token ID to its corresponding `Token` object, which contains ownership information.\n    - `tokenMetadataById`: Maps token IDs to their metadata, which is immutable and does not depend on ownership.\n\n- **Transfer Logic**:\n    The tutorial outlines the logic for transferring an NFT:\n    1. Remove the token from the current owner's set.\n    2. Add the token to the new owner's set.\n    3. Update the mapping for the token ID to reflect the new owner.\n\n### Implementation Steps\n\nThe tutorial directs users to modify the smart contract by implementing the `nft_transfer` function, which will facilitate the transfer of tokens. The following key points are emphasized:\n\n- **Security**: The `assertOneYocto()` function ensures that every transfer call includes a minimal deposit of one yoctoNEAR, enforcing that the transaction is signed with a full access key. This prevents unauthorized access to valuable assets.\n\n- **Internal Logic**: The `internalTransfer` function is responsible for executing the transfer logic. This separation of concerns is a common practice in smart contract design for clarity and modularity.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nThe tutorial indicates that users will implement the `assertOneYocto()` and `internalTransfer` methods in the respective files, guiding them through the coding process necessary to complete the token transfer functionality.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis code snippet serves as an instructional guide for developers working with NFT smart contracts on the NEAR Protocol. By breaking down the necessary steps and emphasizing best practices such as security and state management, the tutorial aims to equip developers with the knowledge to implement core NFT standards effectively."}]}

Let's break it down to understand the key components.\n\n### Overview of Key Components\n\n1. **IssuerMetadata**:\n   - This struct defines metadata for the entire issuer contract.\n   - It includes attributes like `spec`, `name`, `symbol`, `icon`, `base_uri`, `reference`, and `reference_hash`.\n   - **Key Points**:\n     - `spec`: Mandatory field specifying the version.\n     - `name`: The issuer's name.\n     - `symbol`: A token symbol that can represent the issuer (e.g., currency symbols).\n     - `icon`: An optional link or SVG for the issuer's icon.\n     - `base_uri`: A base URI for links that do not start with a scheme.\n     - `reference`: An optional link to more detailed information about the issuer.\n     - `reference_hash`: A hash of the `reference` data, required if `reference` is included.\n\n2. **ClassMetadata**:\n   - This struct holds metadata for a class of SBTs, which applies to all tokens within that class.\n   - Attributes are similar to `IssuerMetadata` but tailored for a specific class.\n   - **Key Points**:\n     - `name`: Mandatory class name.\n     - `symbol`: Optional, can override the issuer's symbol.\n     - `icon`: URL to an icon image with security considerations to prevent SSRF vulnerabilities.\n     - `reference` and `reference_hash`: Similar to `IssuerMetadata`.\n\n3. **TokenMetadata**:\n   - Defines attributes specific to each SBT token.\n   - Includes `class`, `issued_at`, `expires_at`, `reference`, and `reference_hash`.\n   - **Key Points**:\n     - `class`: Required identifier for the token's class.\n     - `issued_at` and `expires_at`: Timestamps for when the token was minted and when it expires, respectively.\n     - `reference` and `reference_hash`: Similar to previous structs.\n\n4. **SBTRegistry Trait**:\n   - This trait provides query methods for interacting with SBT tokens.\n   - **Key Methods**:\n     - `sbt`: Retrieves information about a specific token.\n     - `sbts`: Retrieves information about a list of tokens, returning `None` for any not found.\n     - `sbt_classes`: Queries the class IDs for a list of tokens.\n\n### Time-Related Attributes\nAll time-related attributes in the `TokenMetadata` struct are defined in milliseconds, as indicated by the reference to NEP-171. This standardization helps developers consistently manage timestamps across the protocol.\n\n### Events and Transferability\nThe snippet mentions that traditional transferability is not applicable in this SBT context. Instead, it emphasizes the use of targeted events to accurately reflect the nature of token events. The inclusion of the issuer contract address in these events is crucial for traceability.\n\n### Example Usage\nHere is an example of how you might instantiate and use these structures in a Rust-based NEAR contract:\n\n```rust\n// Example of creating issuer metadata\nlet issuer_metadata = IssuerMetadata {\n    spec: \"sbt-1.0.0\".to_string(),\n    name: \"Mosaics\".to_string(),\n    symbol: \"MOSAIC\".to_string(),\n    icon: Some(\"https://example.com/icon.svg\".to_string()),\n    base_uri: Some(\"https://example.com/\".to_string()),\n    reference: Some(\"https://example.com/metadata.json\".to_string()),\n    reference_hash: Some(Base64VecU8::from(\"hash_string\")),\n};\n\n// Example of creating class metadata\nlet class_metadata = ClassMetadata {\n    name: \"Art Tokens\".to_string(),\n    symbol: Some(\"ART\".to_string()),\n    icon: Some(\"https://example.com/class_icon.svg\".to_string()),\n    reference: Some(\"https://example.com/class_metadata.json\".to_string()),\n    reference_hash: Some(Base64VecU8::from(\"class_hash_string\")),\n};\n\n// Example of creating token metadata\nlet token_metadata = TokenMetadata {\n    class: 1, // Assuming class ID 1 is valid\n    issued_at: Some(1633072800000), // Unix timestamp in milliseconds\n    expires_at: Some(1664608800000), // Another Unix timestamp in milliseconds\n    reference: Some(\"https://example.com/token_metadata.json\".to_string()),\n    reference_hash: Some(Base64VecU8::from(\"token_hash_string\")),\n};\n```\n\n### Conclusion\nThe code snippet from NEP-0393 establishes a clear structure for managing metadata related to SBTs within the NEAR ecosystem. By defining these metadata structures and accompanying traits, developers can build more robust and organized smart contracts that manage SBTs efficiently. The emphasis on time formats and event handling further enhances the standardization needed for interoperability and consistency across different implementations."}]}

It deals with how promises (asynchronous operations) are managed within NEAR smart contracts, particularly concerning the transaction's success or failure.\n\nLet's break down the code and its context step by step:\n\n### Code Explanation\n\n1. **Comment Block**:\n   ```javascript\n   /**\n    * If you want the promise fail also makes the transaction fail, you can simply return the promise from a @call method.\n    */\n   ```\n   This comment explains a behavior related to promises in NEAR. In NEAR, when you invoke a smart contract method (especially those annotated with `@call`), you can return a promise. If this promise fails (for example, if it encounters an error during execution), it will cause the entire transaction to fail. This is important for developers to understand, as it helps manage the flow of success and error handling in smart contract development.\n\n2. **`build` Method**:\n   ```javascript\n   build(): PromiseIndex {\n       return this.constructRecursively();\n   }\n   ```\n   - The `build` method is likely part of a class that handles promise construction and management.\n   - It returns an instance of `PromiseIndex`, which is presumably a type that encapsulates information about the promise being built.\n   - The method calls `this.constructRecursively()`, indicating that the promise is being built through a recursive process, which might involve assembling multiple asynchronous calls into a single promise.\n\n3. **Exporting Type**:\n   ```javascript\n   export type PromiseOrValue<T> = NearPromise | T;\n   ```\n   - This line defines a TypeScript type alias `PromiseOrValue<T>`. \n   - It can either be of type `NearPromise` (which is likely a class or interface representing a NEAR-related promise) or a generic type `T`.\n   - This type allows developers to specify that a variable can be either a promise or a direct value, which provides flexibility in the way functions can be defined and utilized, especially in asynchronous programming.\n\n### Contextual Understanding\n- **Promises in NEAR**: In the context of NEAR smart contracts, promises are used to handle asynchronous operations, such as calling other smart contracts or performing multiple actions within a single transaction. Understanding how to manage promises is crucial to ensure that the smart contract behaves correctly, especially in terms of error handling.\n  \n- **Error Handling**: The comment emphasizes the importance of returning promises from methods. If a promise fails and is returned from a `@call` method, it will cause the transaction to revert, which is a critical aspect of ensuring that users do not execute partial or erroneous transactions.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis code snippet encapsulates key functionalities related to promise management in NEAR's JavaScript SDK. It provides a mechanism to build promises and ensures that developers can handle both promise-based and value-based outputs in a type-safe manner, enhancing the robustness of smart contract development on the NEAR Protocol. Understanding these concepts is essential for writing efficient and error-free dApps on the NEAR blockchain."}]}

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the content:\n\n### Structure of the Document\n\n1. **Front Matter**\n   ```markdown\n   ---\n   id: introduction\n   title: Introduction\n   ---\n   ```\n   This section is known as \"front matter\" and is typically used in Markdown files to define metadata. Here, the `id` is set to \"introduction\", which likely serves as a unique identifier for the document, and the `title` is \"Introduction\", which indicates the main topic of the document.\n\n2. **Introduction to Testing Smart Contracts**\n   ```markdown\n   While developing your smart contract you will want to test that it works as it is supposed to, and moreover, does so securely. In NEAR we have developed tools to help you carry out such tests.\n   ```\n   This paragraph emphasizes the importance of testing smart contracts to ensure they function correctly and securely. It also mentions that NEAR provides tools to facilitate this testing process.\n\n3. **Types of Tests**\n   The document explains two primary types of tests:\n   - **Unit Tests**:\n     ```markdown\n     1. **Unit Tests** to test methods individually. They are written in the contract's language and are executed locally.\n     ```\n     Unit tests focus on testing individual methods of the smart contract in isolation. These tests are written in the same programming language as the contract (e.g., Rust for NEAR smart contracts) and are executed locally, which allows for fast feedback during development.\n\n   - **Integration Tests**:\n     ```markdown\n     2. **Integration Tests** to test how your contract behaves in a realistic environment. You can write them in Rust or Typescript, and execute in a local Sandbox or the NEAR testnet.\n     ```\n     Integration tests assess how different parts of the contract work together and how the contract interacts with other components of the NEAR ecosystem. These tests can be written in either Rust or TypeScript and can be run in a local sandbox environment or on the NEAR testnet, which simulates a live environment.\n\n4. **Recommendations for Testing**\n   ```markdown\n   We recommend all developers to implement both types of tests, since each is suitable to detect different types of errors and make your code intentional. Furthermore, we strongly recommend to first release all projects on testnet, and give users time to try them before releasing them on mainnet.\n   ```\n   The document advises developers to implement both unit and integration tests, as each type serves to uncover different kinds of issues in the code. It also emphasizes the importance of deploying projects on the testnet before going to the mainnet, allowing users to test the contract in a controlled environment and reduce the risk of errors in production.\n\n5. **Setting Up Testing**\n   ```markdown\n   ## Setting Up Testing\n   Testing a smart contract involves using different pieces of software depending on which type of test you are performing. In order to save you from the trouble of setting them up, we recommend you copy the structure from one of our [example projects](https://github.com/near-examples).\n   ```\n   This section introduces the practical aspect of setting up testing for smart contracts. It mentions that the setup will vary depending on the type of test being performed. To simplify the process, it suggests that developers use the structure from existing example projects available on the NEAR GitHub repository.\n\n### Summary\nThis Markdown document serves as a guide for developers working with smart contracts on the NEAR Protocol. It highlights the importance of testing, outlines the types of tests available, and provides recommendations for best practices in testing smart contracts. The document is structured to be informative and actionable, guiding developers towards setting up a robust testing environment for their smart contracts."}]}

It lists changes and improvements made to the NEAR SDK, particularly in versions leading up to `4.0.0-pre.1`. Let's break down the key points mentioned in the snippet:\n\n### Key Changes Explained\n\n1. **Method Signature Change**:\n    - The method on the contract standard now takes `&self` instead of consuming `self`. This change allows methods to borrow the contract instance immutably rather than taking ownership, which can help avoid unnecessary moves and thus improve efficiency and usability.\n\n2. **Fixing `receiver_id` Type**:\n    - The `receiver_id` in `mock::Receipt` was changed from a string to `AccountId`. This change enhances type safety and consistency within the codebase, especially since `AccountId` is a defined type in the NEAR ecosystem.\n\n3. **Moving Runtime Syscalls**:\n    - Runtime syscall functions have been moved to a new crate called `near-sys`. This modularizes the syscall interface, making it cleaner and potentially easier to manage. It also introduces new functions that likely enhance functionality.\n\n### Changes in Version `4.0.0-pre.1`\n\n- **New `LazyOption` Type**:\n    - The introduction of `LazyOption` under the `unstable` feature allows for an optional value that can be lazily loaded, providing flexibility in managing state in smart contracts.\n\n- **Type Aliases and Core Types**:\n    - Moving type aliases and core types to the `near-sdk` crate helps avoid coupling, which can lead to better maintainability and clearer dependencies.\n\n- **Fixes and Improvements**:\n    - Various fixes were made to the `PromiseOrValue` and `TreeMap` implementations, ensuring correct behavior in edge cases and improving overall performance.\n    - The implementation of the `FromStr` trait for JSON types allows for easier parsing of strings into structured types, enhancing developer experience and usability.\n\n- **Logging Improvements**:\n    - The deprecation of `env::log` in favor of `env::log_str` provides a more explicit interface for logging, ensuring that the logs are treated as UTF-8 strings.\n\n- **Allocator Setup**:\n    - The setup of a global allocator for WASM architectures by default simplifies the environment setup for developers, reducing boilerplate code.\n\n- **Consistent Naming**:\n    - The deprecation of `env::block_index` in favor of `env::block_height` ensures consistent terminology, which can help reduce confusion when interacting with the blockchain state.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOverall, the changes documented in this `CHANGELOG.md` snippet reflect ongoing improvements in the NEAR SDK aimed at enhancing usability, performance, and maintainability. The move towards type safety, consistency, and modularity indicates a thoughtful evolution of the SDK to better serve developers building on the NEAR Protocol.\n\nIf you have any specific questions about any of these changes or would like to see examples of how to implement them, feel free to ask!"}]}

The `target_dir` function traverses up the directory structure until it finds the `target` directory.\n\n2. **Asynchronous Command Execution**: The `build_package` function constructs and runs a `cargo build` command asynchronously using the `async_process` crate. It allows the script to execute the build process without blocking the thread.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: The use of `anyhow::Result` provides a convenient way to handle errors and propagate them with context for better debugging.\n\n4. **Main Function**: The `main` function is where the script starts execution. It sets up the conditions for Cargo to know when to rerun the build script based on changes to the script or the package directory.\n\n5. **Conditional Compilation**: The script conditionally compiles a block of code based on whether the \"flamegraph\" feature is enabled, allowing for different build behaviors depending on project configurations.\n\n### Usage Context\n\nThis build script is likely used in a NEAR protocol integration test environment to automate the building of the `mpc-recovery` package, ensuring that it is compiled in release mode and that any changes to the code trigger a rebuild. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity and performance of the integration tests."}]}

It focuses on the `Node` struct and its behavior when it goes out of scope, particularly concerning resource management and cleanup. Let's break down the code step by step.\n\n### Explanation of the Code Snippet\n\n1. **Node Configuration Logging**:\n   ```rust\n   tracing::info!(id = %self.account.id(), ?self.address, \"node killed\");\n   ```\n   - This line logs an informational message using the `tracing` crate, which is commonly used in Rust for structured logging.\n   - The message includes the `id` of the `account` associated with the `Node` and its `address`, indicating that the node process is about to be terminated.\n   - The message \"node killed\" serves as a clear indicator in the logs that the node is being shut down.\n\n2. **Creating a NodeConfig Instance**:\n   ```rust\n   NodeConfig {\n       web_port: self.web_port,\n       account: self.account.clone(),\n       cipher_pk: self.cipher_pk.clone(),\n       cipher_sk: self.cipher_sk.clone(),\n       sign_sk: self.sign_sk.clone(),\n       cfg: self.cfg.clone(),\n       near_rpc: self.near_rpc.clone(),\n   }\n   ```\n   - This block is creating a new instance of `NodeConfig`, which likely holds the configuration settings for the node.\n   - The configuration includes properties such as `web_port`, `account`, cryptographic keys (`cipher_pk`, `cipher_sk`, `sign_sk`), and other relevant settings (`cfg` and `near_rpc`).\n   - The use of `.clone()` indicates that these fields are likely owned types (like `String`, `Vec`, or custom structures) that must be duplicated to avoid ownership issues when moving them into `NodeConfig`.\n\n3. **Drop Trait Implementation**:\n   ```rust\n   impl Drop for Node {\n       fn drop(&mut self) {\n           self.process.kill().unwrap();\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n   - This part implements the `Drop` trait for the `Node` struct. In Rust, the `Drop` trait allows you to specify what happens when an instance of a struct goes out of scope.\n   - The `drop` function is called automatically when the `Node` instance is no longer needed. In this case, it calls `self.process.kill().unwrap()`.\n   - `self.process.kill()` attempts to terminate the process associated with this node. The use of `unwrap()` indicates that the code expects this operation to succeed; if it fails, it will cause a panic.\n   - This ensures that when a `Node` goes out of scope, any associated resources, like processes, are cleaned up properly, preventing resource leaks.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, this code snippet handles the shutdown of a node in the NEAR Protocol integration tests. It logs relevant information before killing the associated process to ensure that resources are managed correctly. The `Drop` trait ensures that the process is terminated when the `Node` instance is dropped, which is key for preventing resource leaks in long-running tests or applications. This pattern is common in Rust for managing resources safely and efficiently."}]}

It demonstrates how to create a simple status message application that allows users to set and retrieve messages associated with their NEAR account IDs. Below is a detailed explanation of each part of the code:\n\n### Import Statements\n```javascript\nimport { NearBindgen, call, view, near } from \"near-sdk-js\";\n```\n- This line imports necessary decorators and utilities from the `near-sdk-js` library. \n  - `NearBindgen`: A decorator that binds the class to the NEAR environment.\n  - `call`: A decorator used to denote a method that changes the state (mutating).\n  - `view`: A decorator used for methods that read state without modifying it (non-mutating).\n  - `near`: An object providing utility functions related to the NEAR runtime, like retrieving the signer account ID.\n\n### Class Definition\n```javascript\n@NearBindgen({\n    deserializer(_value) {\n        throw new Error('deserialize err')\n    },\n})\nexport class StatusMessage {\n    constructor() {\n        this.records = new Map()\n    }\n```\n- The `@NearBindgen` decorator is applied to the `StatusMessage` class, indicating that it's a NEAR smart contract. \n- The `deserializer` function is defined to handle deserialization of contract data. Here, it intentionally throws an error, which can be useful for testing error handling in serialization/deserialization processes.\n- The constructor initializes an instance variable `records` as a `Map`, which will store messages keyed by account IDs.\n\n### Set Status Method\n```javascript\n    @call({})\n    set_status({ message }) {\n        let account_id = near.signerAccountId() // Retrieves the account ID of the user who signed the transaction\n        env.log(`${account_id} set_status with message ${message}`) // Logs the action\n        this.records.set(account_id, message) // Sets the message for the account ID in the records Map\n    }\n```\n- The `@call` decorator marks the `set_status` method as a state-changing method.\n- The method accepts an object containing the `message` to be set.\n- It retrieves the account ID of the user calling the method using `near.signerAccountId()`.\n- It logs the action to the NEAR logs for visibility.\n- Finally, it stores the message in the `records` Map, associating it with the user's account ID.\n\n### Get Status Method\n```javascript\n    @view({})\n    get_status({ account_id }) {\n        env.log(`get_status for account_id ${account_id}`) // Logs the retrieval action\n        return this.records.get(account_id) || null // Retrieves the message for the specified account ID, returning null if not found\n    }\n}\n```\n- The `@view` decorator indicates that the `get_status` method does not modify the state.\n- It accepts an object with the `account_id` for which the status message is requested.\n- It logs the retrieval action for transparency.\n- The method attempts to get the message associated with the provided `account_id` from the `records` Map. If no message exists for that account, it returns `null`.\n\n### Summary\n- This smart contract provides two main functionalities: setting and getting status messages for NEAR account IDs.\n- The `set_status` method updates the state, while the `get_status` method reads from the state without modifying it.\n- The deserialization error handling is included for demonstration purposes, showing how to handle unexpected errors during data processing.\n\n### Example Usage\n1. **Setting a Status**:\n   - A user calls the `set_status` method with a specific message.\n2. **Getting a Status**:\n   - The user calls the `get_status` method with their account ID to retrieve their message.\n\nThis structure provides a straightforward way to manage user messages on the NEAR blockchain, illustrating the use of decorators and state management in NEAR smart contracts."}]}

By exporting these entities, developers can easily import them from this module without needing to know the specific file structure of the package.\n\n### Purpose of the Code\n\nThe purpose of this code snippet is to consolidate and export various abstractions and utilities related to communication with the NEAR blockchain. This structure helps maintain a clean API surface for developers using the `near-api-js` library, as they can access all necessary components for provider functionality from a single module.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, this snippet serves as a module index for the NEAR API JavaScript library, importing and exporting essential classes and functions that facilitate interaction with the NEAR blockchain through various types of providers. This design pattern promotes modularity and ease of use for developers working with NEAR Protocol's JavaScript API."}]}

These keys are generated using `derivation paths` (or `paths` for short).\n\nA `derivation path` is simply a string (e.g. `ethereum-1`, `ethereum-2`, etc) that in conjunction with the NEAR account derives a unique address on the target blockchain.\n\nFor example, we can derive multiple Ethereum addresses from `example.near` by using different paths:\n\n  1. `example.near` + `ethereum-1` = `0x1b48b83a308ea4beb845db088180dc3389f8aa3b`\n  2. `example.near` + `ethereum-2` = `0x99c5d3025dc736541f2d97c3ef3c90de4d221315`\n  3. `example.near` + `...` = `0x...`\n\nIt is important to note that this allows us to discover the **public address** of the foreign account that we can control. To actually control the foreign account, we need to request signatures from the MPC service.\n\n:::tip\nIn practice, the external address is deterministically derived using the NEAR address (`example.near`), the path (`ethereum-1`) and the MPC service's public key\n:::\n\n<hr class=\"subsection\" />\n\n### Multichain Smart Contract\n\nA deployed multichain smart contract is used to request signatures for transactions on other blockchains.\n\nThis contract has a `sign` method that takes two parameters:\n\n  1. The `payload` (transaction) to be signed for the target blockchain\n  2. The `path` that identifies the account you want to use to sign the transaction.\n\nFor example, a user could request a signature to `send 0.1 ETH to 0x060f1...` **(transaction)** using the `ethereum-1` account **(path)**.\n\n\nAfter a request is made, the `sign` method will [yield execution](/blog/yield-resume) waiting while the [MPC signing service](#multi-party-computation-service-mpc) signs the transaction.\n\nOnce the signature is ready, the contract resumes computation and returns it to the user.

This is common in markdown files used for documentation in various frameworks, allowing for structured navigation and linking.\n\n### Introduction\n\n```markdown\nChain signatures enable NEAR accounts, including smart contracts, to sign and execute transactions across many blockchain protocols.\n```\nThis line introduces the concept of chain signatures, emphasizing their role in enabling NEAR accounts and smart contracts to interact with multiple blockchains. This capability enhances blockchain interoperability and gives NEAR accounts control over a variety of assets and data across different blockchain platforms.\n\n### Diagram Reference\n```markdown\n![chain-signatures](/docs/assets/welcome-pages/chain-signatures-overview.png)\n_Diagram of a chain signature in NEAR_\n```\nThis section includes a visual representation (a diagram) to help readers understand the concept better. Diagrams are crucial in technical documentation to illustrate complex interactions or architectures visually.\n\n### How It Works\n\n```markdown\n## How It Works\n```\nThis section outlines the fundamental components that enable chain signatures.\n\n1. **Derivation Paths**: Mechanism to derive foreign addresses from a NEAR account.\n2. **Multichain Smart Contract**: A smart contract that requests signatures for transactions on other blockchains.\n3. **Multiparty Computation Service**: A service that provides signatures without exposing private keys.\n\n### Derivation Paths\n\n```markdown\n### Derivation Paths: One Account, Multiple Chains\n```\nThis subsection explains how chain signatures allow NEAR accounts to derive addresses on other blockchains using derivation paths.\n\n```markdown\nA `derivation path` is simply a string (e.g. `ethereum-1`, `ethereum-2`, etc) that in conjunction with the NEAR account derives a unique address on the target blockchain.\n```\nHere, derivation paths are described as strings that, when combined with a NEAR account, generate unique addresses on other blockchains. This is crucial for managing multiple assets across various chains without the need for multiple accounts.\n\n#### Example of Derivation\n\n```markdown\nFor example, we can derive multiple Ethereum addresses from `example.near` by using different paths:\n  1. `example.near` + `ethereum-1` = `0x1b48b83a308ea4beb845db088180dc3389f8aa3b`\n  2. `example.near` + `ethereum-2` = `0x99c5d3025dc736541f2d97c3ef3c90de4d221315`\n```\nThis example illustrates how different paths can derive different Ethereum addresses, showcasing the flexibility of using a single NEAR account to interact with multiple blockchain networks.\n\n### Multichain Smart Contract\n\n```markdown\n### Multichain Smart Contract\n```\nThis section discusses the smart contract responsible for requesting signatures.\n\n```markdown\nThis contract has a `sign` method that takes two parameters:\n  1. The `payload` (transaction) to be signed for the target blockchain\n  2. The `path` that identifies the account you want to use to sign the transaction.\n```\nThe `sign` method is central to the functionality of the multichain smart contract. It allows users to specify which transaction they want to sign and which account (through the path) should be used for signing.\n\n### Multi-Party Computation Service\n\n```markdown\n### Multi-Party Computation Service\n```\nThis section explains the role of the MPC service in the chain signatures process.\n\n```markdown\nThe essence of Multi-Party Computation (MPC) is to enable independent parties to perform shared computations on private information without revealing secrets to each other.\n```\nMPC is a cryptographic technique that allows multiple parties to collaboratively compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private. In NEAR's context, it allows the signing of transactions without exposing the private keys.\n\n```markdown\nThis service continuously listens for signature requests... and when a call is detected the MPC service:\n  1. Asks its nodes to jointly derive a signature for the `payload` using the account identified by the `path`\n```\nThe MPC service processes requests from users, coordinating between its nodes to create a valid signature for the requested transaction.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe markdown file provides a comprehensive overview of chain signatures in the NEAR ecosystem, detailing the mechanisms that facilitate cross-chain transactions securely and efficiently. The use of derivation paths, multichain smart contracts, and MPC services highlights NEAR's innovative approach to achieving blockchain interoperability. This document is designed for developers and contributors who wish to understand or implement the chain signature feature within NEAR Protocol."}]}

Below, I will break down the code and explain its key components in detail.\n\n### Imports\n```typescript\nimport { isMobile } from \"is-mobile\";\nimport { signTransactions } from \"@near-wallet-selector/wallet-utils\";\nimport type {\n  WalletModuleFactory,\n  WalletBehaviourFactory,\n  JsonStorageService,\n  Account,\n  HardwareWallet,\n  Transaction,\n  Optional,\n} from \"@near-wallet-selector/core\";\nimport { getActiveAccount } from \"@near-wallet-selector/core\";\nimport { isLedgerSupported, LedgerClient } from \"./ledger-client\";\nimport type { Subscription } from \"./ledger-client\";\nimport type { Signer } from \"near-api-js\";\nimport * as nearAPI from \"near-api-js\";\nimport type { FinalExecutionOutcome } from \"near-api-js/lib/providers\";\nimport icon from \"./icon\";\n```\n- **is-mobile**: A utility to check if the current device is mobile.\n- **@near-wallet-selector/wallet-utils**: Utility functions for wallet interactions, including transaction signing.\n- **@near-wallet-selector/core**: Core types and functions for wallet management.\n- **ledger-client**: This module provides functionalities specific to Ledger device communication.\n- **near-api-js**: The official JavaScript library for interacting with the NEAR blockchain.\n\n### Interfaces\n```typescript\ninterface LedgerAccount extends Account {\n  derivationPath: string; // Path used to derive the account's keys\n  publicKey: string; // Public key associated with the account\n}\n\ninterface ValidateAccessKeyParams {\n  accountId: string; // Account ID for access key validation\n  publicKey: string; // Public key to validate\n}\n\ninterface LedgerState {\n  client: LedgerClient; // Instance to communicate with the Ledger device\n  accounts: Array<LedgerAccount>; // Array of Ledger accounts\n  subscriptions: Array<Subscription>; // Subscriptions for event handling\n}\n\nexport interface LedgerParams {\n  iconUrl?: string; // Optional icon URL for the wallet\n  deprecated?: boolean; // Flag to mark deprecated features\n}\n\nconst STORAGE_ACCOUNTS = \"accounts\"; // Key for storing accounts in local storage\n```\n- These interfaces define the structure of data used throughout the code, including Ledger accounts, parameters for validating access keys, and the overall state of the Ledger wallet.\n\n### Ledger State Setup\n```typescript\nconst setupLedgerState = async (\n  storage: JsonStorageService\n): Promise<LedgerState> => {\n  const accounts = await storage.getItem<Array<LedgerAccount>>(STORAGE_ACCOUNTS);\n\n  return {\n    client: new LedgerClient(), // Initialize the Ledger client\n    subscriptions: [], // Initialize subscriptions array\n    accounts: accounts || [], // Retrieve existing accounts or initialize an empty array\n  };\n};\n```\n- This function initializes the state of the Ledger wallet by setting up the client and fetching accounts from storage.\n\n### Ledger Wallet Behaviour Factory\n```typescript\nconst Ledger: WalletBehaviourFactory<HardwareWallet> = async ({\n  options,\n  store,\n  provider,\n  logger,\n  storage,\n  metadata,\n}) => {\n  const _state = await setupLedgerState(storage); // Set up the Ledger state\n\n  const signer: Signer = {\n    createKey: () => {\n      throw new Error(\"Not implemented\"); // Placeholder for key creation\n    },\n    getPublicKey: async (accountId) => {\n      const account = _state.accounts.find((a) => a.accountId === accountId);\n      if (!account) throw new Error(\"Failed to find public key for account\");\n      return nearAPI.utils.PublicKey.from(account.publicKey); // Convert to NEAR public key format\n    },\n    signMessage: async (message, accountId) => {\n      const account = _state.accounts.find((a) => a.accountId === accountId);\n      if (!account) throw new Error(\"Failed to find account for signing\");\n      const signature = await _state.client.sign({\n        data: message,\n        derivationPath: account.derivationPath, // Signing using the account's derivation path\n      });\n      return {\n        signature,\n        publicKey: nearAPI.utils.PublicKey.from(account.publicKey), // Return signature and public key\n      };\n    },\n  };\n```\n- This section defines the core functionality of the Ledger wallet, including how to get the public key and sign messages.\n\n### Account Management\n```typescript\n  const getAccounts = (): Array<Account> => {\n    return _state.accounts.map((x) => ({\n      accountId: x.accountId,\n      publicKey: \"ed25519:\" + x.publicKey, // Format public key for NEAR\n    }));\n  };\n\n  const cleanup = () => {\n    _state.subscriptions.forEach((subscription) => subscription.remove()); // Remove all subscriptions\n    _state.subscriptions = []; // Reset subscriptions\n    _state.accounts = []; // Clear accounts\n    storage.removeItem(STORAGE_ACCOUNTS); // Remove accounts from storage\n  };\n\n  const signOut = async () => {\n    if (_state.client.isConnected()) {\n      await _state.client.disconnect().catch((err) => {\n        logger.log(\"Failed to disconnect device\");\n        logger.error(err); // Handling disconnection errors\n      });\n    }\n    cleanup(); // Clean up state\n  };\n\n  const connectLedgerDevice = async () => {\n    if (_state.client.isConnected()) return; // Do nothing if already connected\n    await _state.client.connect(); // Connect to the Ledger device\n  };\n```\n- These functions manage Ledger accounts, handle cleanup on sign-out, and manage the connection state of the Ledger device.\n\n### Access Key Validation\n```typescript\n  const validateAccessKey = ({\n    accountId,\n    publicKey,\n  }: ValidateAccessKeyParams) => {\n    logger.log(\"validateAccessKey\", { accountId, publicKey });\n    return provider.viewAccessKey({ accountId, publicKey }).then(\n      (accessKey) => {\n        logger.log(\"validateAccessKey:accessKey\", { accessKey });\n        if (accessKey.permission !== \"FullAccess\") {\n          throw new Error(\"Public key requires 'FullAccess' permission\");\n        }\n        return accessKey; // Return access key if valid\n      },\n      (err) => {\n        if (err.type === \"AccessKeyDoesNotExist\") {\n          return null; // Return null if access key does not exist\n        }\n        throw err; // Throw error for other types\n      }\n    );\n  };\n```\n- This function validates access keys for accounts to ensure they have the necessary permissions.\n\n### Transaction Transformation\n```typescript\n  const transformTransactions = (\n    transactions: Array<Optional<Transaction, \"signerId\" | \"receiverId\">>\n  ): Array<Transaction> => {\n    const { contract } = store.getState();\n    if (!contract) throw new Error(\"Wallet not signed in\");\n    const account = getActiveAccount(store.getState());\n    if (!account) throw new Error(\"No active account\");\n\n    return transactions.map((transaction) => {\n      return {\n        signerId: transaction.signerId || account.accountId,\n        receiverId: transaction.receiverId || contract.contractId,\n        actions: transaction.actions,\n      };\n    });\n  };\n```\n- This function transforms transactions to ensure they have the correct signer and receiver IDs, using the active account and contract information from the store.\n\n### Summary\nThe code snippet provides a comprehensive implementation of a Ledger wallet integration within the NEAR ecosystem, allowing users to manage their accounts securely, validate access keys, and sign transactions. Each function and utility is designed to ensure secure interactions with the Ledger hardware wallet, while also providing logging and error handling for a smooth user experience."}]}

Let's break down the provided code snippet and the context surrounding it.\n\n### Code Overview\n\nThe snippet includes a part of a React component that renders a widget using NEAR's component library. Here's a detailed explanation of the code snippet you provided:\n\n```jsx\nreturn (\n  <Widget\n    src=\"near/widget/DIG.Tooltip\"\n    props={{\n      content: \"This is my tooltip content.\",\n      trigger: (\n        <Widget src=\"near/widget/DIG.Button\" props={{ label: \"Hover Me\" }} />\n      ),\n    }}\n  />\n);\n```\n\n#### Explanation of Key Elements\n\n1. **Widget Component**:\n   - The `<Widget>` component is a functional component provided by the NEAR ecosystem that allows you to create reusable UI elements. It takes the `src` prop to specify the source of the widget and a `props` object to pass properties to the widget.\n\n2. **src Prop**:\n   - The `src` prop indicates the source location of the widget being used. In this case, it refers to a tooltip component (`DIG.Tooltip`) in the NEAR component library.\n\n3. **props Object**:\n   - The `props` object contains properties that define how the widget behaves and appears.\n   - `content`: This specifies the text that will be displayed inside the tooltip when it appears. In this case, it is set to \"This is my tooltip content.\"\n   - `trigger`: This defines the element that will trigger the tooltip when hovered over. It is another `<Widget>` that renders a button (`DIG.Button`) with the label \"Hover Me\".\n\n### Additional Context\n\n#### DIG.Tooltip Component\n- The `DIG.Tooltip` component is mentioned to be built using Radix primitives, which are accessible UI components designed to be robust and accessible. Tooltips are typically used to provide additional information upon hovering over an element.\n\n#### WidgetEditor\n- The code is wrapped inside a `<WidgetEditor>` tag, which is likely a component that allows developers to interactively edit and preview the widget in a live environment.\n\n### Understanding the Documentation Context\n- The documentation provides an overview of various components (like `DIG.Tabs`, `DIG.Toast`, and `DIG.Tooltip`).\n- Each section includes a brief description of the component's purpose, properties, and how to use it with example code snippets.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis snippet provides a straightforward example of how to implement a tooltip using NEAR's design system. By using the `<Widget>` component and specifying the necessary properties, developers can create interactive and user-friendly UI elements in their dApps. The documentation context further enhances understanding by providing links to specific component details, which can help developers understand how to utilize these components effectively in their applications."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain the following code snippet from NEAR repository file `docs/3.tutorials/crosswords/03-intermediate/04-cross-contract-calls.md`:\n``` be adding:\n\n1. `claim_reward` — when the user has an existing account and wishes to send the prize to it\n2. `claim_reward_new_account` — when the user doesn't have an account, wants to create one and send the prize to it\n\nBoth functions will do cross-contract calls and use callbacks to see the result. We finally get to the meat of this chapter, let's go!\n\n## Cross-contract calls\n\n### The traits\n\nWe're going to be making a cross-contract call to the linkdrop account deployed to the `testnet` account. We're also going to have callbacks for that, and for a simple transfer to a (potentially existing) account. We'll create the traits that define both those methods.\n\n<Github language=\"rust\" start=\"17\" end=\"43\" url=\"https://github.com/near-examples/crossword-tutorial-chapter-3/blob/master/contract/src/lib.rs\" />\n\n:::tip\nIt's not necessary to create the trait for the callback as we could have just implemented the functions `callback_after_transfer` and `callback_after_create_account` in our `Crossword` struct implementation. We chose to define the trait and implement it to make the code a bit more readable.\n:::\n\n### `claim_reward`\n\nAgain, this function is called when the user solves the crossword puzzle and wishes to send the prize money to an existing account.\n\nSeems straightforward, so why would we need a callback? We didn't use a callback in the previous chapter when the user logged in, so what gives?\n\nIt's possible that while claiming the prize, the user accidentally fat-fingers their username, or their cat jumps on their keyboard. Instead of typing `mike.testnet` they type `mike.testnzzz` and hit send. In short, if we try to send the prize to a non-existent account, we want to catch that.\n\nFor brevity, we'll skip some code in this function to focus on the Promise and callback:\n\n```rust\npub fn claim_reward(\n    &mut self,\n    crossword_pk: PublicKey,\n    receiver_acc_id: String,\n    memo: String,\n    ) -> Promise {\n        let signer_pk = env::signer_account_pk();\n        ...\n        Promise::new(receiver_acc_id.parse().unwrap())\n            .transfer(reward_amount)\n            .then(\n                Self::ext(env::current_account_id())\n                    .with_static_gas(GAS_FOR_ACCOUNT_CALLBACK)\n                    .callback_after_transfer(\n                        crossword_pk,\n                        receiver_acc_id,\n                        memo,\n                        env::signer_account_pk(),\n                    ),\n            )\n    }\n```\n\n:::tip Your IDE is your friend\n\nOftentimes, the IDE can help you.\n\nFor instance, in the above snippet we have `receiver_acc_id.parse().unwrap()` which might look confusing. You can lean on code examples or documentation to see how this is done, or you can utilize the suggestions from your IDE.\n\n:::\n\nThis `claim_reward` method will attempt to use the `Transfer` Action to send NEAR to the account specified. It might fail on a protocol level (as opposed to a smart contract failure), which would indicate the account doesn't exist.\n\nLet's see how we check this in the callback:\n\n<Github language=\"rust\" start=\"372\" end=\"400\" url=\"https://github.com/near-examples/crossword-tutorial-chapter-3/blob/master/contract/src/lib.rs\" />\n\n:::info The `#[private]` macro\nNotice that above the function, we have declared it to be private.\n\nThis is an ergonomic helper that checks to make sure the predecessor is the current account ID.\n\nWe actually saw this done \"the long way\" in the callback for the linkdrop contract in [the previous section](03-linkdrop.md#the-callback).\n\nEvery callback will want to have this `#[private]` macro above it.\n:::\n\nThe snippet above essentially says it expects there to be a Promise result for exactly one Promise, and then sees if that was successful or not. Note that we're not actually getting a *value* in this callback, just if it succeeded or failed.\n\nIf it succeeded, we proceed to finalize the puzzle, like setting its status to be claimed and finished, removing it from the `unsolved_puzzles` collection, etc.\n\n### `claim_reward_new_account`\n\nNow we want to handle a more interesting case. We're going to do a cross-contract call to the smart contract located on `testnet` and ask it to create an account for us. This name might be unavailable, and this time we get to write a callback that *gets a value*.\n\nAgain, for brevity, we'll show the meat of the `claim_reward_new_account` method:\n\n```rust\npub fn claim_reward_new_account(\n    &mut self,\n    crossword```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The provided code snippet is from a NEAR contract tutorial that involves cross-contract calls in Rust. It describes the implementation of two functions, `claim_reward` and `claim_reward_new_account`, which handle the distribution of rewards to users who participate in a crossword puzzle game. Let's break down the key components of this code and its context.\n\n### Overview of Cross-Contract Calls\n\nCross-contract calls in NEAR allow one smart contract to call another contract's function. This is particularly useful when you want to interact with different contracts, such as transferring tokens or creating new accounts.\n\n### Functions Explained\n\n1. **`claim_reward`**: This function is invoked when a user wants to claim their prize by sending it to an existing NEAR account. The function includes a callback mechanism to handle the outcome of the transfer. If the transfer fails (e.g., due to an invalid account ID), the callback will handle the error.\n\n    ```rust\n    pub fn claim_reward(\n        &mut self,\n        crossword_pk: PublicKey,\n        receiver_acc_id: String,\n        memo: String,\n    ) -> Promise {\n        let signer_pk = env::signer_account_pk(); // Get the public key of the account initiating the call\n        ...\n        // Create a promise to transfer the reward to the specified account\n        Promise::new(receiver_acc_id.parse().unwrap())\n            .transfer(reward_amount) // Transfer the specified amount of NEAR\n            .then(\n                Self::ext(env::current_account_id()) // Specify the current contract as the callback target\n                    .with_static_gas(GAS_FOR_ACCOUNT_CALLBACK) // Set the gas limit for the callback\n                    .callback_after_transfer(\n                        crossword_pk,\n                        receiver_acc_id, // Pass the account ID to the callback\n                        memo, // Any additional information (memo)\n                        env::signer_account_pk(), // Signer public key\n                    ),\n            )\n    }\n    ```\n\n    - **Promise**: The `Promise::new(receiver_acc_id.parse().unwrap())` creates a new promise to send NEAR to the `receiver_acc_id`.\n    - **Transfer**: The `.transfer(reward_amount)` method specifies the amount to be transferred.\n    - **Callback**: The `.then(...)` method chains a callback function that will execute after the transfer attempt, allowing you to check if the transfer succeeded or failed.\n\n2. **Callback Handling**: The callback function checks the result of the transfer. If the transfer is successful, it will finalize the puzzle's state (e.g., marking it as claimed).\n\n    ```rust\n    #[private] // Ensure this function can only be called by the contract itself\n    pub fn callback_after_transfer(\n        &mut self,\n        crossword_pk: PublicKey,\n        receiver_acc_id: String,\n        memo: String,\n        signer_pk: PublicKey,\n    ) {\n        // Check if the promise (transfer) was successful\n        assert!(env::promise_results_count() == 1, \"Expected exactly one promise result\");\n        let result = env::promise_result(0); // Get the result of the first promise\n        \n        match result {\n            PromiseResult::Successful(_) => {\n                // Handle success - finalize the puzzle\n                self.finalize_puzzle(crossword_pk, receiver_acc_id, memo, signer_pk);\n            }\n            _ => {\n                // Handle failure - the account might not exist\n                env::log(\"Transfer failed. The account may not exist.\".as_bytes());\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n### `claim_reward_new_account`\n\nThe second function, `claim_reward_new_account`, handles the scenario where the user does not have an existing account and wants to create one. Similar to `claim_reward`, it also involves cross-contract calls but includes additional logic for account creation.\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **Callbacks**: Callbacks are crucial for handling asynchronous operations such as transfers. They ensure that you can react to the outcome of a cross-contract call (success or failure).\n- **Error Handling**: Using callbacks allows you to handle potential errors, such as invalid account IDs.\n- **Private Functions**: The `#[private]` attribute is used to restrict access to certain functions, ensuring that only the contract itself can call them.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis code snippet illustrates a practical use case of cross-contract calls within the NEAR ecosystem, emphasizing robust error handling and user experience. By implementing callbacks, the contract can gracefully manage various scenarios that might arise during execution, such as handling non-existent accounts during reward claims."}]}

This message will be shown to the user when prompted for an action.\n   - The variant itself holds a value of type `self::add_action::AddAction`, indicating that this action corresponds to a specific action type defined in the `add_action` module.\n\n```rust\n    #[strum_discriminants(strum(message = \"skip         - Skip adding a new action\"))]\n    /// Go to transaction signing\n    Skip(super::skip_action::SkipAction),\n}\n```\n\n6. **Second Variant**:\n   - The `Skip` variant also has a custom message to indicate that the user can skip adding a new action.\n   - It holds a value of type `super::skip_action::SkipAction`, which suggests that it refers to another action type defined in a sibling module named `skip_action`.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe `NextAction` enum is designed to facilitate user interaction when constructing a transaction in the NEAR Protocol. It provides a structured way to present different actions (like adding a new action or skipping) to the user, along with associated messages for clarity. The use of the `strum` library enhances the functionality of the enum, allowing for easy iteration and user-friendly messages. Overall, this enum plays a crucial role in command-line interactions related to transaction construction in the NEAR ecosystem."}]}

Let's break down the snippet for a clearer understanding:\n\n```typescript\n/**\n * A string that represents a NEAR account ID.\n */\nexport declare type AccountId = string;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Comment Block (`/** ... */`)**:\n   - This is a TypeScript JSDoc comment, which serves to document the purpose of the `AccountId` type. It indicates that this type is used to represent a NEAR account ID, providing clarity to developers who might use or modify this code in the future.\n\n2. **`export` Keyword**:\n   - The `export` keyword makes the `AccountId` type available for import in other files. This means that other parts of the NEAR SDK or user applications can utilize this type when working with account IDs.\n\n3. **`declare` Keyword**:\n   - The `declare` keyword is used in TypeScript to define types that exist elsewhere, such as in a library or external code. In this case, it indicates that `AccountId` is not a concrete implementation in this file but a type alias that represents a string.\n\n4. **`type AccountId = string;`**:\n   - This line is creating a type alias named `AccountId` that is equivalent to a `string`. In TypeScript, type aliases are used to give a name to a specific type or union of types. Here, `AccountId` is simply a more descriptive way of referring to a string that is specifically intended to represent a NEAR account ID.\n\n### Summary:\n\nIn summary, this code snippet defines a type alias `AccountId` for a string in TypeScript and documents it as representing a NEAR account ID. This kind of type declaration helps provide better type checking and clarity in the codebase, making it easier for developers to understand that whenever they see `AccountId`, they should treat it as a string that uniquely identifies a NEAR account. Using such type definitions helps improve code readability and maintainability in TypeScript applications."}]}

The string itself does not contain any executable code or script but rather serves as a means to encode data (such as an SVG image, PNG, or other graphical format) for use in a web application or user interface.\n\n### Explanation of the Code Snippet\n\n1. **Base64 Encoding**: \n   - Base64 is a method for encoding binary data into ASCII string format. This is commonly used in web applications to embed images or other media directly into HTML or CSS files. \n   - The encoded string can be decoded to retrieve the original binary data, which can then be rendered as an image.\n\n2. **Usage in NEAR Applications**:\n   - In the context of a NEAR Protocol application, this encoded data might be used as an icon for a wallet, a dApp interface, or some other graphical element. The `icon.ts` file suggests it's related to graphical representations, potentially for wallet interfaces like Narwallets.\n   \n3. **Decoding the Data**:\n   - To utilize this data, you would typically decode it back into binary to display it in a web page. For instance, if this is an image, it could be rendered in an `<img>` tag or as a background image in CSS.\n\n### Example of Decoding and Using Base64 Data in a Web Application\n\nHere’s a simple example of how to use such an encoded string in a web application:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Base64 Icon Example</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <!-- Using the Base64 encoded string in an img tag -->\n    <img src=\"data:image/png;base64,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\" alt=\"Icon\" />\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Key Points\n- **Data URI Scheme**: The `data:image/png;base64,` prefix indicates that the following string is a Base64-encoded PNG image. You would replace `image/png` with the appropriate MIME type if the data represents a different format (like SVG or JPEG).\n- **Performance Considerations**: While embedding images using Base64 can reduce HTTP requests, it can increase the size of HTML files and may lead to performance issues with larger images. For performance-sensitive applications, consider serving images from external sources.\n\nThis example illustrates how such encoded data can be effectively utilized within a web application context, contributing to the user interface of NEAR-based applications."}]}

Then it select one of the shortest path to the target peer and sends a [`RoutedMessage`](Messages.md#routedmessage) to the first peer in the path.\n\nWhen it receives a [`RoutedMessage`](Messages.md#routedmessage), it check if it is the target, in that case consume the body of the message, otherwise it finds a route to the target following described approach and sends the message again. It is important that before routing a message each peer check signature from original author of the message, passing a message with invalid signature can result in ban for the sender.

If this message is not for the node processing it, it decrement the field by one before routing it; if the value is 0, the node drops the message instead of routing it.\n\n#### Routing back\n\nIt is possible that node `A` is known to `B` but not the other way around. In case node `A` sends a request that requires a response to `B`, the response is routed back through the same path used to send the message from `A` to `B`.

It covers several key components, including how peers are connected, how edges are maintained, and how messages are routed between peers. Below, I will break down the main elements of the routing table and the code snippets that manage updates to it.\n\n### Key Components of the Routing Table\n\n1. **peer_forwarding**:\n   - This is a mapping for each node \\( S \\) to the set of peers that can be used to route messages to a target peer \\( T \\). If \\( S \\) does not have a direct connection to \\( T \\), it selects one of the peers from `peer_forwarding[S]` to relay the message.\n\n2. **edges_info**:\n   - This mapping associates each unordered pair of peers \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) with the edge that has the highest nonce known between them. The nonce is a unique identifier for messages that helps to determine the most recent or valid connection state.\n\n3. **route_back**:\n   - This structure is used for managing responses to messages that require a reply. It allows messages to be sent back along the same path they arrived.\n\n4. **raw_graph**:\n   - This is a graphical representation of the network, where nodes are peers and edges represent active connections. It is used for calculating the shortest paths between peers.\n\n### Code Explanation\n\n#### 1. Updating Edges\n\nThe function `on_edges_received` updates the `edges_info` mapping when new edges are received.\n\n```python\ndef on_edges_received(self, edges):\n    for edge in edges:\n        # Check the edge is valid\n        if edge.is_valid():\n            peer0 = edge.peer0\n            peer1 = edge.peer1\n\n            # Find edge with higher nonce known up to this point.\n            current_edge = self.routing_table.edges_info.get((peer0, peer1))\n\n            # If there is no known edge, or the known edge has smaller nonce\n            if current_edge is None or current_edge.nonce < edge.nonce:\n                # Update with the new edge\n                self.routing_table.edges_info[(peer0, peer1)] = edge\n```\n\n- **Functionality**: This function iterates over received edges, validating them, and checks if the current known edge has a lower nonce. If so, it updates the routing table with the new edge, ensuring that the routing information reflects the most recent network state.\n\n#### 2. Announcing Accounts\n\nThe function `on_announce_accounts_received` updates the `account_peers` mapping when new account announcements are received.\n\n```python\ndef on_announce_accounts_received(self, announcements):\n    for announce_account in announcements:\n        # Check the announcement is valid\n        if announce_account.is_valid():\n            account_id = announce_account.account_id\n\n            # Find most recent announcement for account_id being announced\n            current_announce_account = self.routing_table.account_peers.get(account_id)\n\n            # If new epoch is happens after current epoch.\n            if announce_account.epoch > current_announce_account.epoch:\n                # Update with the new announcement\n                self.routing_table.account_peers[announce_id] = announce_account\n```\n\n- **Functionality**: Similar to the edge updates, this function processes account announcements, validating each and ensuring that the most recent announcement is recorded in the routing table based on the epoch.\n\n### Message Routing\n\n- When a node needs to send a message, it consults the routing table. If it is not directly connected to the target peer, it will select a peer along the shortest path to route the message. Each `RoutedMessage` contains a time-to-live (TTL) integer, which decrements with each hop. If TTL reaches zero, the message is dropped.\n\n- Nodes also check the signature of incoming messages to ensure validity. An invalid signature can lead to banning the sender, maintaining network integrity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis section of the NEAR Protocol's `NetworkSpec.md` provides a detailed look at how nodes manage peer connections and route messages efficiently. The routing table plays a crucial role in maintaining the network's connectivity and ensuring messages are delivered accurately and securely. The code snippets illustrate the mechanisms for updating the routing table in response to network changes, which is fundamental for the decentralized nature of NEAR's architecture."}]}

Here's a breakdown explaining the key sections and concepts presented in the document:\n\n### Overview\n\n- **Title and ID**: The document is titled \"NEAR Lake Indexer\" and has an identifier of `near-lake`, which is used for internal linking within the documentation.\n\n- **Introduction to NEAR Lake**: \n  - NEAR Lake is described as an indexer built on top of the NEAR Indexer Framework. Its primary purpose is to monitor the NEAR blockchain network and store various event logs (like Fungible Token and Non-Fungible Token events) in JSON format on AWS S3.\n  - This allows developers and applications to access event logs easily and efficiently.\n\n- **GitHub Repository**: \n  - A link to the source code of the Lake Indexer is provided, encouraging developers to explore the implementation.\n\n### How It Works\n\n- **Hosted by Pagoda**: \n  - The document mentions that Pagoda Inc. operates the NEAR Lake nodes, simplifying the access to this service for users. This means users do not need to set up their own instances unless they have specific needs that require it.\n\n- **AWS S3 Buckets**: \n  - Two S3 buckets are created for different networks (testnet and mainnet), both located in the `eu-central-1` region. \n  - The setup requires the requester to pay for access, meaning users connecting to these buckets will incur charges on their AWS accounts.\n\n### Data Structure\n\n- **Data Organization**: \n  - The document describes the organizational structure of the data stored in the S3 buckets. Each block's data is stored under a directory named with the block height in a specific format (a 12-character long `u64` string with leading zeros).\n  - The files under each block height include:\n    - `block.json`: Contains a JSON-serialized representation of the `BlockView` struct. There is a note indicating that this struct may change in the future, with announcements to follow.\n    - `shard_N.json`: Represents data for each shard in the block, where `N` is the shard index (starting from 0). Users can determine the number of shards from the `block.json` file by checking the `chunks_included` field.\n\n### How to Use It\n\n- **NEAR Lake Framework**: \n  - A mention of the NEAR Lake Framework is included, which simplifies the process of creating an indexer based on the data stored in NEAR Lake.\n  - A link is provided to a release announcement on the NEAR Governance Forum, indicating the community engagement and development surrounding the framework.\n\n- **Video Tutorial**: \n  - An embedded video tutorial is included to provide a visual and practical introduction to using the NEAR Lake Indexer, enhancing the learning experience for developers.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis document serves as a comprehensive guide for developers interested in utilizing the NEAR Lake Indexer for event logging on the NEAR Protocol. It explains the architecture, data structure, and practical usage of the indexer, along with resources for further exploration and understanding. The structure of the document is user-friendly, with clear headings and sections that facilitate quick navigation and comprehension."}]}

It uses the `near-workspaces` library to set up a sandbox environment for testing NEAR smart contracts. Let's break down the code step-by-step.\n\n### Imports and Setup\n```javascript\nimport { Worker } from \"near-workspaces\"; // Importing the Worker class from near-workspaces for sandbox testing\nimport test from \"ava\"; // Importing the ava testing framework for writing and running tests\n\ntest.before(async (t) => {\n  // Init the worker and start a Sandbox server\n  const worker = await Worker.init(); // Initializes a NEAR sandbox worker\n\n  // Prepare sandbox for tests, create accounts, deploy contracts, etc.\n  const root = worker.rootAccount; // Get the root account from the worker\n\n  // Create a sub-account for high-level promise tests\n  const highlevelPromise = await root.createSubAccount(\"highlevel-promise\", {\n    initialBalance: \"100100N\", // Initial balance for the account\n  });\n  await highlevelPromise.deploy(\"build/highlevel-promise.wasm\"); // Deploy the high-level promise contract\n\n  // Create and deploy a callee contract\n  const calleeContract = await root.createSubAccount(\"callee-contract\");\n  await calleeContract.deploy(\"build/promise_api.wasm\"); // Deploy the callee contract\n\n  // Create test user accounts\n  const ali = await root.createSubAccount(\"ali\");\n  const bob = await root.createSubAccount(\"bob\");\n  const carl = await root.createSubAccount(\"carl\");\n\n  // Save state for test runs\n  t.context.worker = worker; // Store the worker in the test context\n  t.context.accounts = {\n    root,\n    highlevelPromise,\n    ali,\n    bob,\n    carl,\n    calleeContract,\n  }; // Store the created accounts in the test context\n});\n```\n\n### Test Cleanup\n```javascript\ntest.after.always(async (t) => {\n  await t.context.worker.tearDown().catch((error) => {\n    console.log(\"Failed to tear down the worker:\", error); // If teardown fails, log the error\n  });\n});\n```\nThis section ensures that the sandbox environment is properly cleaned up after the tests run, preventing any resource leaks.\n\n### Test Cases\nThe following sections define various test cases to verify the functionality of the smart contracts.\n\n#### 1. Testing Account Creation and Transfer\n```javascript\ntest(\"highlevel promise create account, transfer\", async (t) => {\n  const { bob, highlevelPromise } = t.context.accounts; // Destructure accounts from the context\n\n  // Call the method to create and transfer to a new account\n  let r = await bob.callRaw(\n    highlevelPromise,\n    \"test_promise_batch_create_transfer\",\n    \"\",\n    { gas: \"100 Tgas\" } // Specify the gas limit for the transaction\n  );\n  // Assert that the executor ID is correct\n  t.is(\n    r.result.receipts_outcome[1].outcome.executor_id,\n    highlevelPromise.getSubAccount(\"a\").accountId\n  );\n  // Assert that the status of the transaction is success\n  t.is(r.result.receipts_outcome[1].outcome.status.SuccessValue, \"\");\n\n  // Check the balance of the new account\n  let balance = await highlevelPromise.getSubAccount(\"a\").balance();\n  t.is(balance.total.toString(), \"10000000000000000000000000\");\n});\n```\nThis test verifies that an account can be created and funded correctly through a method call.\n\n#### 2. Testing Stake Functionality\n```javascript\ntest(\"highlevel promise stake\", async (t) => {\n  const { highlevelPromise } = t.context.accounts;\n  await highlevelPromise.callRaw(\n    highlevelPromise,\n    \"test_promise_batch_stake\",\n    \"\",\n    { gas: \"100 Tgas\" }\n  );\n  let balance = await highlevelPromise.balance(); // Check the balance after staking\n  t.is(balance.staked.toString(), \"100000000000000000000000000000\"); // Verify the staked amount\n});\n```\nThis test checks the ability to stake tokens in the high-level promise account.\n\n#### 3. Testing Access Key Management\n```javascript\ntest(\"highlevel promise add full access key\", async (t) => {\n  const { bob, highlevelPromise } = t.context.accounts;\n  let r = await bob.callRaw(\n    highlevelPromise,\n    \"test_promise_add_full_access_key\",\n    \"\",\n    { gas: \"100 Tgas\" }\n  );\n  t.is(r.result.status.SuccessValue, \"\"); // Ensure the operation was successful\n});\n\n// Similar test for function call key\ntest(\"highlevel promise add function call key\", async (t) => {\n  const { bob, highlevelPromise } = t.context.accounts;\n  let r = await bob.callRaw(\n    highlevelPromise,\n    \"test_promise_add_function_call_access_key\",\n    \"\",\n    { gas: \"100 Tgas\" }\n  );\n  t.is(r.result.status.SuccessValue, \"\"); // Ensure the operation was successful\n});\n```\nThese tests verify that the account can add full access and function call access keys correctly.\n\n#### 4. Testing Account Deletion\n```javascript\ntest(\"highlevel promise delete account\", async (t) => {\n  const { bob, highlevelPromise } = t.context.accounts;\n  let r = await bob.callRaw(highlevelPromise, \"test_delete_account\", \"\", {\n    gas: \"100 Tgas\",\n  });\n  t.is(r.result.status.SuccessValue, \"\"); // Check if the deletion was successful\n  t.is(await highlevelPromise.getSubAccount(\"e\").exists(), false); // Verify that the account no longer exists\n});\n```\nThis test checks that an account can be deleted as expected.\n\n#### 5.

This method ensures the command can be parsed correctly as if it was executed in a shell.\n\n4. **Command Parsing into Struct**:\n   - The command is parsed into a variant of `JsCmd`, specifically `JsCmd::Send`. This indicates that the input command is expected to be a sending transaction command.\n   - The `else` part of the statement triggers a panic if the command parsed does not match the expected `Send` variant, ensuring type safety and correctness.\n\n5. **Assertion for Validation**:\n   - Finally, the code compares the output generated from the parsed command arguments, using `SendArgs::to_cli_args`, with the expected output. \n   - `shell_words::join` is used to reassemble the arguments into a string format. If they do not match, the test will fail, indicating an issue with the command parsing or argument handling.\n\n### Purpose\n\nThe code snippet is likely part of a test suite aimed at validating the command-line interface (CLI) commands related to sending NEAR tokens. It ensures that the expected command matches the actual command generated by the parsing logic, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of user interactions with the NEAR Protocol CLI.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis code encapsulates a robust mechanism for testing the parsing of CLI commands in the NEAR Protocol's ecosystem. It validates that user commands for sending tokens are correctly recognized and translated into the appropriate internal representations required for execution."}]}

This makes it difficult to provide a meaningful explanation or analysis.\n\nHowever, I can give you a general overview of what you might find in a TypeScript definition file (`.d.ts`) related to a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) standard in the NEAR Protocol ecosystem.\n\n### Overview of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) in NEAR\n\nIn NEAR, Non-Fungible Tokens are a specialized type of token that are unique and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis like fungible tokens (e.g., NEAR tokens). Each NFT has its own distinct properties and metadata, making them suitable for representing digital assets like art, collectibles, and other unique items.\n\n### Typical Structure of NFT TypeScript Definitions\n\nIn a TypeScript definition file for NFTs, you would usually find:\n\n1. **Interfaces**: Definitions for the structure of NFT contracts. This may include methods for minting, transferring, and querying NFTs.\n2. **Events**: Definitions for events emitted during transactions involving NFTs, such as creation or transfer events.\n3. **Metadata**: Structures that define how metadata about NFTs is specified, often including properties like title, description, and image URLs.\n\n### Example Snippet\n\nHere’s a hypothetical example of what part of an NFT TypeScript definition might look like:\n\n```typescript\n// Interface defining the structure of an NFT\nexport interface NonFungibleToken {\n    // Method to mint a new NFT\n    mint(to: string, tokenId: string, metadata: TokenMetadata): Promise<void>;\n\n    // Method to transfer an NFT\n    transfer(from: string, to: string, tokenId: string): Promise<void>;\n\n    // Method to get NFT metadata\n    getTokenMetadata(tokenId: string): Promise<TokenMetadata>;\n\n    // Event emitted when a new NFT is minted\n    onMinted: (tokenId: string, owner: string) => void;\n\n    // Event emitted when an NFT is transferred\n    onTransferred: (tokenId: string, from: string, to: string) => void;\n}\n\n// Structure for token metadata\nexport interface TokenMetadata {\n    title: string;\n    description: string;\n    media: string; // URL to the media asset\n    // Other properties can be added as needed\n}\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIf you can provide the context or additional lines before the closing brace, I would be able to help you better understand that specific snippet.

As the last action in a sequence of batched actions.\n2. For a smart contract to delete its own account.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n1. **Locked Contract**: \n   - An account with no access keys cannot sign transactions, meaning actions can only be executed from within the contract's code.\n\n2. **delete_account Action**:\n   - This action is used to delete an account and can only be executed under certain conditions.\n\n### Code Explanation\n\nBoth the JavaScript and Rust implementations follow a similar structure, demonstrating how to create an account, transfer a minimum amount of NEAR tokens, and then delete that account.\n\n#### JavaScript Implementation\n\n```javascript\nimport { NearBindgen, near, call, NearPromise } from 'near-sdk-js'\nimport { AccountId } from 'near-sdk-js/lib/types'\n\nconst MIN_STORAGE: bigint = BigInt(\"1000000000000000000000\") // 0.001Ⓝ\n\n@NearBindgen({})\nclass Contract {\n  @call({})\n  create_delete({prefix, beneficiary}:{prefix: String, beneficiary: AccountId}) {\n    // Construct a new account ID using a prefix and the current account ID\n    const account_id = `${prefix}.${near.currentAccountId()}`\n\n    // Create a new account, transfer minimum storage, and delete the beneficiary account\n    NearPromise.new(account_id)\n      .createAccount()\n      .transfer(MIN_STORAGE)\n      .deleteAccount(beneficiary)\n  }\n\n  @call({})\n  self_delete({beneficiary}:{beneficiary: AccountId}) {\n    // Self-delete the current contract account and transfer funds to the beneficiary\n    NearPromise.new(near.currentAccountId())\n      .deleteAccount(beneficiary)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- **`create_delete` Method**: \n  - This method creates a new account using a specified prefix, transfers a minimum amount of NEAR tokens, and deletes the account specified by the `beneficiary`.\n  \n- **`self_delete` Method**: \n  - This method allows the contract to delete its own account, transferring any remaining funds to the specified beneficiary.\n\n#### Rust Implementation\n\n```rust\nuse near_sdk::{near, env, Promise, AccountId};\n\n#[near(contract_state)]\n#[derive(Default)]\npub struct Contract { }\n\nconst MIN_STORAGE: Balance = 1_000_000_000_000_000_000_000; // 0.001Ⓝ\n\n#[near]\nimpl Contract {\n  pub fn create_delete(&self, prefix: String, beneficiary: AccountId){\n    // Construct the new account ID\n    let account_id = prefix + \".\" + &env::current_account_id().to_string();\n    \n    // Create a new account, transfer minimum storage, and delete the beneficiary account\n    Promise::new(account_id.parse().unwrap())\n      .create_account()\n      .transfer(MIN_STORAGE)\n      .delete_account(beneficiary);\n  }\n\n  pub fn self_delete(&self, beneficiary: AccountId){\n    // Self-delete the current contract account and transfer funds to the beneficiary\n    Promise::new(env::current_account_id())\n      .delete_account(beneficiary);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- The Rust implementation closely mirrors the JavaScript version, with the main difference being syntax and the use of the `Promise` type instead of `NearPromise`.\n\n### Warnings\n\nThe documentation includes important warnings regarding the `delete_account` action:\n\n- If the beneficiary account does not exist, the funds will be lost and distributed among validators.\n- It is advised **not** to use `delete` to fund a new account, as the account must exist prior to deletion.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis code snippet illustrates how to handle account deletion within NEAR smart contracts effectively, ensuring developers understand both the implications of locked contracts and the correct usage of the `delete_account` action. The careful construction of account IDs and the handling of funds is critical to prevent token loss."}]}

Each field has a specific purpose:\n  - `publicKey`: The public key associated with the signature that allows the verification process to confirm its validity.\n  - `signature`: The actual signature that needs to be checked against the provided message.\n  - `message`: The data that was signed, which is necessary for the verification process.\n  - `nonce`: A buffer to ensure that each signature is unique, which helps prevent replay attacks (where an old signature could be used maliciously).\n  - `recipient`: The account ID of the intended recipient, which may be relevant for the context of the transaction.\n  - `callbackUrl`: An optional field that allows for a callback to be specified, which could be useful for asynchronous processing.\n\n### 3. `VerifyFullKeyBelongsToUserParams` Interface\n```typescript\nexport interface VerifyFullKeyBelongsToUserParams {\n  publicKey: string;      // The public key to be verified.\n  accountId: string;      // The account ID that should own the provided public key.\n  network: Network;       // The network context in which the verification is taking place.\n}\n```\n- This interface is designed for verifying that a given public key is indeed associated with a specific user account. The parameters include:\n  - `publicKey`: The public key that needs to be verified.\n  - `accountId`: The account ID that is expected to own the public key.\n  - `network`: The blockchain network context (e.g., mainnet or testnet) in which this verification is being performed.\n\n### 4. `ViewAccessKeyParams` Interface\n```typescript\nexport interface ViewAccessKeyParams {\n  accountId: string;      // The account ID for which access keys are being viewed.\n  network: Network;       // The network context to ensure the correct access keys are fetched.\n  publicKey: string;      // The public key for which the access key details are required.\n}\n```\n- This interface outlines the parameters needed to view access key details for a specific account. The fields include:\n  - `accountId`: The account ID that holds the access keys.\n  - `network`: The context of the network, ensuring that the correct access key information is retrieved.\n  - `publicKey`: The public key for which the access key information is being requested.\n\n### Summary\nThese interfaces are critical in the NEAR Protocol's operations regarding signature verification and access key management. By defining precise types for these parameters, the code helps ensure type safety and better documentation, which ultimately aids developers in understanding and implementing functionality related to security and user authentication on the NEAR blockchain."}]}

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the key components and concepts discussed in the snippet:\n\n### Overview of the Code Snippet\n\n1. **Context of the Example**:\n   - The example revolves around a Guest Book smart contract that allows users to post messages. Users can also make payments to mark their messages as \"premium\".\n   - The state of this contract previously tracked the messages and their associated payments separately.\n\n2. **Initial State Structure**:\n   - The state of the contract is represented in two programming languages: JavaScript and Rust, showcasing how to implement and manage the initial contract's state.\n   - The initial state includes a vector for payments separate from the messages, which is essential for understanding how to migrate the state later.\n\n3. **Contract Update**:\n   - The contract is updated so that the payment information is included directly within each `PostedMessage`, rather than being stored in a separate vector.\n   - This change necessitates a migration of the existing data to the new structure, as the old and new states are incompatible.\n\n4. **Incompatibility Issues**:\n   - When deploying the updated contract, if the contract tries to read the old state, it will fail due to:\n     - The presence of an extra `payments` vector that the new contract structure does not recognize.\n     - The `PostedMessages` from the old contract not having the new `payment` field.\n\n5. **State Migration Implementation**:\n   - To resolve the incompatibility issues, a migration method is implemented. This method:\n     - Iterates through the old state to remove the separate `payments` vector.\n     - Updates each `PostedMessage` to include the payment information directly within its structure.\n   - The migration method is marked as an initialization method that ignores the existing state (`[#init(ignore_state)]`), allowing the contract to rewrite its state upon deployment.\n\n6. **Resources and Further Learning**:\n   - The snippet provides links to the actual code implementations in both JavaScript and Rust.\n   - It also references additional resources, such as migration examples and test files that can help developers understand the migration process step-by-step.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n- **Smart Contract Migration**: The process of updating the state structure of a smart contract while preserving necessary data. This is crucial when making changes that are not backward-compatible.\n  \n- **State Structure**: The way data is organized in a smart contract. Changes to this structure require careful handling to ensure that existing data can be adapted to the new format without loss.\n\n- **Initialization Methods**: Special functions in NEAR smart contracts that can be used to set up the contract's state when it is deployed. They can be designed to ignore existing state data to allow for complete reinitialization.\n\n### Example Code Snippets\n\nHere are simplified versions of the concepts illustrated in the migration process:\n\n#### JavaScript Example (Initial Contract)\n\n```javascript\n// Initial state representation\nclass GuestBook {\n    constructor() {\n        this.messages = []; // Array of messages\n        this.payments = []; // Separate payments vector\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### JavaScript Example (Updated Contract)\n\n```javascript\n// Updated state representation\nclass PostedMessage {\n    constructor(message, payment) {\n        this.message = message; // Message text\n        this.payment = payment; // Payment info integrated\n    }\n}\n\nclass GuestBook {\n    constructor() {\n        this.postedMessages = []; // Array of PostedMessage\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Migration Function (JavaScript)\n\n```javascript\nasync function migrateState() {\n    const oldState = await loadOldState(); // Load old state\n    const newState = new GuestBook();\n\n    // Migrate messages and combine with payments\n    for (let i = 0; i < oldState.messages.length; i++) {\n        const message = oldState.messages[i];\n        const payment = oldState.payments[i]; // Corresponding payment\n        newState.postedMessages.push(new PostedMessage(message, payment));\n    }\n\n    await saveNewState(newState); // Save the new state\n}\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe provided code snippet explains the migration of a smart contract's state on the NEAR Protocol, emphasizing the importance of managing state changes carefully when updating contract structures. By understanding how to implement migrations, developers can ensure smooth transitions between contract versions without losing critical data."}]}

This code likely resides in a module handling RPC (Remote Procedure Call) requests for account management.\n\n### Key Components of the Code\n\n1. **Block Reference**:\n   ```rust\n   let block_ref = self.block_ref.unwrap_or_else(BlockReference::latest);\n   ```\n   This line retrieves a block reference. If no specific block reference is provided (`self.block_ref`), it defaults to the latest block available. This is crucial for operations that may depend on the state of the blockchain at a specific point in time.\n\n2. **Account View**:\n   ```rust\n   let mut account_view = self\n       .from_network\n       .view_account(from_account_id)\n       .block_reference(block_ref.clone())\n       .await?;\n   ```\n   This code asynchronously fetches the current view of the account specified by `from_account_id` from the blockchain network referenced by `self.from_network`. The method `view_account` is called with the specified block reference.\n\n3. **Account Balance Initialization**:\n   ```rust\n   if let Some(initial_balance) = self.initial_balance {\n       account_view.balance = initial_balance;\n   }\n   ```\n   If `initial_balance` is defined, it sets the balance of the account to this value. This could be useful when creating a new account or modifying an existing one to ensure it has a specific balance.\n\n4. **Patch Transaction Creation**:\n   ```rust\n   let mut patch = PatchTransaction::new(&self.into_network, into_account_id.clone())\n       .account(account_view.into())\n       .access_key(pk, AccessKey::full_access());\n   ```\n   A new `PatchTransaction` is created, targeting the account specified by `into_account_id`. It initializes the transaction with the current account details and sets a full access key for the account.\n\n5. **Code Hash Check**:\n   ```rust\n   if code_hash != CryptoHash::default() {\n       let code = self\n           .from_network\n           .view_code(from_account_id)\n           .block_reference(block_ref.clone())\n           .await?;\n       patch = patch.code(&code);\n   }\n   ```\n   This block checks whether the account has a non-default code hash. If it does, it retrieves the contract code associated with the account and adds it to the patch transaction. This ensures that the contract code is maintained or updated as part of the account patching process.\n\n6. **Importing State**:\n   ```rust\n   if self.import_data {\n       let states = self\n           .from_network\n           .view_state(from_account_id)\n           .block_reference(block_ref)\n           .await?;\n       patch = patch.states(\n           states\n               .iter()\n               .map(|(key, value)| (key.as_slice(), value.as_slice())),\n       );\n   }\n   ```\n   If the `import_data` flag is set, it retrieves the current state of the account and adds it to the patch. This allows the account to be updated with existing state data, ensuring that the new account reflects the current state of the old account.\n\n7. **Transaction Execution**:\n   ```rust\n   patch.transact().await?;\n   Ok(Contract::new(signer, self.into_network.coerce()))\n   ```\n   Finally, the transaction is executed asynchronously, which will apply all the changes specified in the patch. If successful, it returns a new instance of a `Contract`, indicating that the patching process was completed.\n\n### Supporting Structures and Methods\n\n- **`PatchTransaction` Struct**:\n  The `PatchTransaction` struct holds the details required to patch an account, including account ID, state records, and account updates. It provides methods for modifying various aspects of the account, such as the account details, access keys, and contract code.\n\n- **Methods**:\n  - `account`: Adds an account details patch.\n  - `account_from_current`: Enables updating account details based on the current state fetched from the blockchain.\n  - `access_key`: Adds or overwrites an access key.\n  - `code`: Sets or updates the contract code.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis code snippet encapsulates a process for modifying an account's state on NEAR Protocol by creating a patch transaction. It retrieves the current state and code of the account and allows for modifications, including updating the account's balance and access keys. The structured approach enables developers to safely and efficiently manage account states in accordance with the NEAR blockchain's principles."}]}

This snippet primarily focuses on the operations related to node removal and maintaining the balance of the tree after such operations. I'll break down the important sections of the code and explain the key functionalities and concepts.\n\n### Overview of the Code\n\n1. **Handling Node Removal**:\n   The code handles the case where a node needs to be removed from the tree. Depending on whether the node to be removed has a left or right subtree, it performs different operations.\n\n2. **Key Updates**:\n   After a node is removed, it updates the key of the node that replaces it (in the case of a node having children). This is crucial to maintain the integrity of the tree.\n\n3. **Balancing the Tree**:\n   The tree may become unbalanced after a node removal. The `check_balance` method is called to ensure the tree maintains its properties, starting from the affected node up to the root.\n\n4. **Swapping Nodes**:\n   The `swap_with_last` function is used to replace the node being removed with the last node in the tree. This helps in efficiently managing the structure of the underlying vector representation of the tree.\n\n### Key Functions Explained\n\n#### Node Removal Logic\n```rust\nif let Some(lft) = lft_opt {\n    // Proceed with the left subtree\n    let (n, mut p) = self.max_at(lft, r_node.id).unwrap();\n    let k = n.key.clone();\n\n    ...\n    self.check_balance(self.root, &p.key)\n} else {\n    // Proceed with the right subtree\n    let rgt = rgt_opt.unwrap();\n    let (n, mut p) = self.min_at(rgt, r_node.id).unwrap();\n    let k = n.key.clone();\n\n    ...\n    self.check_balance(self.root, &p.key)\n}\n```\n- **Left vs Right Subtree**: The code first checks if there is a left subtree (`lft_opt`). If so, it finds the maximum key from the left subtree to replace the removed node. If not, it processes the right subtree to find the minimum key.\n- **Key Updating**: It refreshes the key of the node being adjusted after the swap to ensure consistency, especially in small trees where IDs might overlap.\n\n#### Swapping Nodes\n```rust\nfn swap_with_last(&mut self, id: u64) {\n    if id == self.len() - 1 {\n        // No operation needed if it's already the last element\n        self.tree.pop();\n        return;\n    }\n\n    let key = self.node(self.len() - 1).map(|n| n.key).unwrap();\n    let (mut n, mut p) = self.lookup_at(self.root, &key).unwrap();\n\n    ...\n    self.tree.pop();\n}\n```\n- **Efficiency**: This function checks if the node to be removed is the last node. If so, it simply pops it off. Otherwise, it finds the node with the maximum ID, updates its position in the tree, and then removes the last node.\n- **Tree Integrity**: By ensuring nodes are swapped rather than simply removed, the method maintains the tree's structure without leaving gaps.\n\n### Debugging and Iteration Implementations\n```rust\nimpl<K, V> std::fmt::Debug for TreeMap<K, V> { ... }\nimpl<'a, K, V> IntoIterator for &'a TreeMap<K, V> { ... }\nimpl<K, V> Iterator for Cursor<'_, K, V> { ... }\n```\n- **Debug Implementation**: Provides a way to print the `TreeMap` structure, including the root and the tree itself, which is useful for debugging.\n- **Iterator Implementation**: The `IntoIterator` and `Iterator` traits are implemented to allow traversing the `TreeMap` in an ascending order, enhancing usability in Rust.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis code snippet is a critical part of the `TreeMap` implementation in NEAR's SDK. It efficiently manages the removal of nodes, ensures the tree remains balanced, and provides mechanisms for debugging and iteration over the tree structure. Understanding this code is essential for developers working with the NEAR Protocol's data structures, as it highlights key concepts in tree management and Rust programming practices."}]}

It defines a class called `CleanState` that serves as a simple key-value storage contract. Below is a detailed breakdown of the code, explaining each part and its functionality.\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n```typescript\nimport { NearBindgen, call, view, near } from \"near-sdk-js\";\n```\n- **Imports**: The code imports functions and decorators from the `near-sdk-js` library, which is a toolkit for building smart contracts on the NEAR blockchain.\n  - **NearBindgen**: A decorator that marks a class as a smart contract.\n  - **call**: A decorator used for methods that change the state of the contract.\n  - **view**: A decorator used for methods that read the state without modifying it.\n  - **near**: An object that provides functions to interact with the NEAR blockchain, such as reading and writing to storage.\n\n```typescript\n@NearBindgen({})\nexport class CleanState {\n```\n- **Class Definition**: The `CleanState` class is defined and marked with the `@NearBindgen` decorator, indicating that this class is a NEAR smart contract. The empty object `{}` passed to the decorator signifies that there are no specific configurations.\n\n#### Method: `clean`\n\n```typescript\n  @call({})\n  clean({ keys }) {\n    keys.forEach((key) => near.storageRemove(key));\n  }\n```\n- **Decorator**: The `@call({})` decorator indicates that this method can be called to modify the contract's state.\n- **Method Purpose**: The `clean` method takes an object with a `keys` property, which is expected to be an array of keys.\n- **Functionality**: It iterates through the `keys` array and removes each corresponding entry from the contract's storage using `near.storageRemove(key)`. This effectively clears the specified entries from the state.\n\n#### Method: `put`\n\n```typescript\n  @call({})\n  put({ key, value }) {\n    near.storageWrite(key, value);\n  }\n```\n- **Decorator**: Like `clean`, the `@call({})` indicates that this method modifies the contract state.\n- **Method Purpose**: The `put` method accepts an object with `key` and `value` properties.\n- **Functionality**: It writes the provided `value` to storage under the specified `key` using `near.storageWrite(key, value)`. This method allows users to store data in the contract's state.\n\n#### Method: `get`\n\n```typescript\n  @view({})\n  get({ key }) {\n    return near.storageRead(key);\n  }\n}\n```\n- **Decorator**: The `@view({})` decorator indicates that this method can be called to read the contract's state without modifying it.\n- **Method Purpose**: The `get` method takes an object with a `key` property.\n- **Functionality**: It retrieves the value associated with the provided `key` from storage using `near.storageRead(key)` and returns it. This method allows users to read data stored in the contract.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe `CleanState` smart contract provides basic key-value storage functionality on the NEAR Protocol. It allows users to:\n- **Store** values with a specific key using the `put` method.\n- **Retrieve** values by key using the `get` method.\n- **Remove** multiple entries from the storage using the `clean` method.\n\nThis small contract demonstrates how to interact with NEAR's storage capabilities and provides a foundation for building more complex smart contracts."}]}

Importing the BlogPage Component\n```javascript\nimport BlogPage from \"./pages/BlogPage\";\n```\n- This line imports the `BlogPage` component from the `./pages/BlogPage` file. This component will handle the rendering of the blog feed when users navigate to the blog route.\n\n#### 2. Defining Routes for the Application\n```javascript\n<Route path={\"/signin\"}>\n  <NavigationWrapper {...passProps} />\n  <SignInPage {...passProps} />\n</Route>\n<Route path={\"/bosblog\"}>\n  <NavigationWrapper {...passProps} />\n  <BlogPage {...passProps} />\n</Route>\n```\n- In this section, two routes are defined using React Router:\n  - The first route (`/signin`) handles user sign-in functionality.\n  - The second route (`/bosblog`) is for the blog page.\n- Each route renders a `NavigationWrapper` component (which likely includes navigation elements) and the respective component (`SignInPage` for the sign-in route and `BlogPage` for the blog route).\n- The `passProps` is an object that contains props passed down to these components, which might be used for managing state or user information.\n\n#### 3. Contributors List\n```javascript\nconst contributors = ['near', 'jacksonthedev.near'];\n```\n- This constant defines an array of contributor account IDs whose promoted blog posts will be displayed on the blog feed.\n- Only posts from these accounts will appear when someone browses to the `/bosblog` URL.\n\n### Summary\nThis snippet illustrates how to set up a basic routing structure for a blog within a NEAR Protocol application using React. By importing the necessary components and defining routes, the application can navigate between different pages (sign-in and blog) while maintaining shared navigation elements.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- **Promoted Posts:** The tutorial explains that only posts from the specified contributors will be shown on the blog. This is a control mechanism to curate content that appears on the blog.\n- **Markdown Support:** The tutorial also mentions that blog posts can be formatted using Markdown, which is a lightweight markup language. This allows users to write formatted text easily.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis code snippet is a part of setting up a blogging feature in a NEAR application. It demonstrates basic routing, component structure, and how to manage which posts appear based on contributor accounts. Following this setup, developers can enhance their application with user-generated content in a structured way."}]}

This code is primarily focused on handling Ethereum-style transactions within the NEAR Protocol ecosystem, particularly in the context of an Ethereum wallet integration.\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n```javascript\nimport { parseAbi } from \"viem\";\n```\n- **Imports the `parseAbi` function**: This function is imported from the `viem` library. `parseAbi` is likely used to interpret Ethereum's ABI (Application Binary Interface), which defines how to interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n```javascript\nexport const ETHEREUM_ACCOUNT_ABI = parseAbi([\n  \"function functionCall(string receiver_id, string method_name, bytes args, uint64 gas, uint32 yoctoNear) payable\",\n  \"function transfer(string receiver_id, uint32 yoctoNear) payable\",\n  \"function addKey(uint8 public_key_kind, bytes public_key, uint64 nonce, bool is_full_access, bool is_limited_allowance, uint128 allowance, string receiver_id, string[] method_names) external\",\n  \"function deleteKey(uint8 public_key_kind, bytes public_key) external\",\n]);\n```\n- **Defines `ETHEREUM_ACCOUNT_ABI`**: This constant holds the parsed ABI of Ethereum-style functions that are relevant for NEAR transactions.\n  - **`functionCall`**: This function allows calling another NEAR contract function, specifying the receiver, method name, arguments, gas limit, and the amount of NEAR to send with the call.\n  - **`transfer`**: This function is used to send NEAR tokens to another account.\n  - **`addKey`**: This function adds a new access key to an account, allowing various permissions based on the parameters such as public key, nonce, and allowance settings.\n  - **`deleteKey`**: This function removes an existing access key from an account.\n\nEach function is defined with its respective parameters and visibility (e.g., `payable` indicates that the function can accept ETH/NEAR payments).\n\n```javascript\nexport const DEFAULT_ACCESS_KEY_ALLOWANCE = \"250000000000000000000000\"; // 0.25 NEAR\n```\n- **Defines `DEFAULT_ACCESS_KEY_ALLOWANCE`**: This constant sets a default allowance for access keys, specifically for 0.25 NEAR. This value is likely used to limit the amount of NEAR that can be spent by transactions authorized by a specific access key.\n\n```javascript\nexport const RLP_EXECUTE = \"rlp_execute\";\n```\n- **Defines `RLP_EXECUTE`**: This constant likely refers to a specific method or operation related to RLP (Recursive Length Prefix) encoding, which is commonly used in Ethereum for serializing data. Here, it may signify a command to execute a transaction.\n\n```javascript\nexport const MAX_TGAS = BigInt(270e12); // Handle overhead of rlp_execute to validate the Ethereum transaction.\n```\n- **Defines `MAX_TGAS`**: This constant sets a maximum gas limit for executing the `rlp_execute` function, represented as a `BigInt`. The significant value (270 trillion) accounts for the overhead associated with validating Ethereum transactions, ensuring that enough gas is provided for execution.\n\n```javascript\nexport class EthTxError extends Error {}\n```\n- **Defines `EthTxError`**: This class extends the built-in `Error` class and is likely used to handle errors specifically related to Ethereum transactions within the NEAR ecosystem. By creating a custom error class, developers can throw and catch errors in a more structured way.\n\n### Summary\nThe code snippet outlines essential components for integrating Ethereum-like transactions into the NEAR Protocol, defining function signatures, constants for allowances and limits, and a custom error class for handling transaction-related exceptions. Understanding these constructs is crucial for developers working to bridge Ethereum functionality within NEAR's environment."}]}

Here's a detailed explanation of the relevant parts of the snippet:\n\n### Overview of the Code Snippet\n\n1. **Base64 Decoding**:\n   - The snippet mentions base64 decoding a response that contains a JSON payload. This is typically used to receive data from blockchain transactions, where the response may be encoded for transmission efficiency. The key to look for in the decoded JSON is the `amount` key, which indicates the number of fungible tokens successfully transferred.\n\n2. **Transfer and Call Functionality**:\n   - The `ft_transfer_call` function allows one contract to transfer fungible tokens to another contract while also invoking a specified function on the receiving contract. This is akin to the Ethereum EIP-677 proposal, which allows for token transfer along with a callback.\n\n3. **Successful Transfer Example**:\n   - The snippet provides a practical example of initiating a token transfer:\n     - **NEAR CLI Commands**: There are two ways to initiate the transfer:\n       - **Short Command**: A simple command to call the `ft_transfer_call` function with minimal parameters.\n       - **Full Command**: A more detailed command that specifies the transaction as a full transaction request, including gas and deposit amounts.\n     - Each command uses placeholders (`<ft_contract_id>`, `<defi_contract_id>`, `<user_account_id>`) that need to be replaced with actual values.\n\n4. **Transaction Representation**:\n   - The YAML snippet represents the structure of the transaction being sent to the NEAR blockchain. Key fields include:\n     - `block_hash`: The hash of the block where the transaction is included.\n     - `signer_id`: The account ID initiating the transaction.\n     - `receiver_id`: The ID of the contract receiving the tokens.\n     - `actions`: Contains the details of the function call action, including method name, arguments (in JSON format), gas, and deposit.\n\n5. **JSON RPC Call**:\n   - The final part demonstrates how to send a raw transaction to the NEAR RPC endpoint using a POST request. The payload is a base64-encoded string representing the transaction.\n\n### Example Code Snippet\n\nHere is an example of how you might implement the `ft_transfer_call` function in Rust for a fungible token contract:\n\n```rust\n#[near_bindgen]\nimpl FungibleToken {\n    // Function to transfer tokens and call another contract\n    pub fn ft_transfer_call(\n        &mut self,\n        receiver_id: String,\n        amount: U128,\n        msg: String,\n    ) -> Promise {\n        // Ensure the sender has enough balance\n        let sender_id = env::predecessor_account_id();\n        assert!(self.accounts.get(&sender_id).unwrap_or(0) >= amount.0, \"Not enough balance\");\n\n        // Update the balances\n        self.accounts.insert(&sender_id, &(self.accounts.get(&sender_id).unwrap() - amount.0));\n        self.accounts.insert(&receiver_id, &(self.accounts.get(&receiver_id).unwrap_or(0) + amount.0));\n\n        // Call the receiving contract with the provided message\n        Promise::new(receiver_id).function_call(\n            \"on_ft_transfer\".to_string(),\n            json!({\n                \"sender_id\": sender_id,\n                \"amount\": amount,\n                \"msg\": msg,\n            }).to_string().into_bytes(),\n            0, // no attached deposit\n            env::prepaid_gas() - 100 // subtract some gas for the function call\n        )\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis code snippet is a practical guide on how to transfer fungible tokens using NEAR Protocol's `ft_transfer_call` function, explaining both the mechanics of the transfer and the integration with smart contracts. The detailed commands and transaction representations provide developers with the necessary tools to implement and troubleshoot their own token transfer functionality within the NEAR ecosystem."}]}

The code appears to be handling operations related to a `FreeList` data structure, leveraging the Borsh serialization format for data handling. Let's break down the various parts of the code snippet:\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n1. **Operation Handling**:\n   The main logic here operates within a match statement that processes different operations on a `FreeList` and a corresponding hashmap `hm`. Each operation is defined as an `Op` variant.\n\n   ```rust\n   match operation {\n       Op::Flush => {\n           sv.flush();\n       }\n       Op::Reset => {\n           let serialized = borsh::to_vec(&sv).unwrap();\n           sv = FreeList::deserialize(&mut serialized.as_slice()).unwrap();\n       }\n       Op::Get(k) => {\n           let k = k % (sv.len() + 1);\n           let r1 = sv.get(FreeListIndex(k));\n           let r2 = hm.get(&k);\n           assert_eq!(r1, r2);\n       }\n       Op::Clear => {\n           sv.clear();\n           hm.clear();\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n   - **Flush**: This operation calls the `flush` method on the `sv` object (presumably an instance of `FreeList`), which likely writes any pending changes to persistent storage.\n   \n   - **Reset**: This operation serializes the current state of `sv` into a byte vector and then deserializes it back into `sv`. This may be used to reset the state to a serialized version, possibly for rollback or state management.\n   \n   - **Get(k)**: The `Get` operation retrieves a value from `sv` using a modified index `k`. The index is wrapped using modulo to ensure it stays within bounds. It then asserts that the value retrieved from `sv` matches the value from the hashmap `hm` for the same key.\n   \n   - **Clear**: This operation clears both `sv` and `hm`, effectively resetting them.\n\n2. **Borsh Schema Test**:\n   The test function `test_borsh_schema` checks the Borsh serialization schema for a `FreeList` instance containing a struct `NoSchemaStruct`.\n\n   ```rust\n   #[cfg(feature = \"abi\")]\n   #[test]\n   fn test_borsh_schema() {\n       #[derive(borsh::BorshSerialize, borsh::BorshDeserialize, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord)]\n       struct NoSchemaStruct;\n\n       assert_eq!(\n           \"FreeList\".to_string(),\n           <FreeList<NoSchemaStruct> as borsh::BorshSchema>::declaration()\n       );\n       let mut defs = Default::default();\n       <FreeList<NoSchemaStruct> as borsh::BorshSchema>::add_definitions_recursively(&mut defs);\n       insta::assert_snapshot!(format!(\"{:#?}\", defs));\n   }\n   ```\n\n   - **Declaration Check**: It first asserts that the Borsh schema declaration for a `FreeList` containing `NoSchemaStruct` is equal to the string \"FreeList\".\n   \n   - **Recursive Definitions**: It creates a mutable variable `defs` to hold schema definitions and calls `add_definitions_recursively` to populate it with the definitions for `FreeList`. Finally, it uses the `insta` crate to assert that the captured snapshot of `defs` matches the expected output.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis code snippet demonstrates the handling of various operations on a `FreeList` data structure and sets up a test to validate its Borsh serialization schema. The use of assertions ensures that the operations maintain consistency between the `FreeList` and the hashmap, which is critical for data integrity in blockchain applications. The Borsh serialization ensures that the data can be efficiently serialized and deserialized, which is vital for state persistence in smart contracts on the NEAR Protocol."}]}

Here’s a detailed explanation of each section:\n\n### Overview\n\nIn the context of NEAR Protocol, users can interact with their accounts to check balances of various types of tokens, including NEAR tokens, Fungible Tokens (FT), and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT). The commands use the `near` CLI, which is a command-line interface for interacting with the NEAR blockchain.\n\n### Viewing NEAR Token Balance\n\n```bash\nnear tokens \\\n    fro_volod.testnet \\\n    view-near-balance \\\n    network-config testnet \\\n    now\n```\n\n- **Command Breakdown**:\n  - `near tokens`: This is the main command to interact with token-related functions.\n  - `fro_volod.testnet`: This is the specific NEAR account for which the balance is being queried.\n  - `view-near-balance`: This sub-command retrieves the balance of NEAR tokens.\n  - `network-config testnet`: Specifies the network configuration to use, in this case, the testnet.\n  - `now`: Indicates that the balance should be viewed as of the current block height.\n\n- **Expected Output**:\n  The command returns a detailed balance, including the amount available for transfer, total balance, and any locked amounts (for storage or fees). For example:\n  ```\n  fro_volod.testnet account has 169.589001320890476999999994 NEAR available for transfer (the total balance is 172.482461320890476999999994 NEAR, but 2.89246 NEAR is locked for storage and the transfer transaction fee is ~0.001 NEAR)\n  ```\n\n### Viewing Fungible Token Balance\n\n```bash\nnear tokens \\\n    fro_volod.testnet \\\n    view-ft-balance usdn.testnet \\\n    network-config testnet \\\n    now\n```\n\n- **Command Breakdown**:\n  - `view-ft-balance usdn.testnet`: This sub-command checks the balance of a specific fungible token (here, `usdn.testnet`).\n  \n- **Expected Output**:\n  The output indicates the amount of FT tokens held by the account. For example:\n  ```\n  fro_volod.testnet account has \"31942967677775774595\" FT tokens (FT-contract: usdn.testnet)\n  ```\n\n### Viewing Non-Fungible Token Assets\n\n```bash\nnear tokens \\\n    fro_volod.testnet \\\n    view-nft-assets paras-token-v2.testnet \\\n    network-config testnet \\\n    now\n```\n\n- **Command Breakdown**:\n  - `view-nft-assets paras-token-v2.testnet`: This checks the NFT assets held by the account, specifying the NFT contract (`paras-token-v2.testnet`).\n\n- **Expected Output**:\n  The output provides a list of NFT tokens owned by the account, along with their metadata. An example output snippet would look like:\n  ```json\n  fro_volod.testnet account has NFT tokens:\n  [\n    {\n      \"approved_account_ids\": {},\n      \"metadata\": {\n        \"copies\": 100,\n        \"description\": null,\n        \"issued_at\": \"1657613801537412611\",\n        \"media\": \"bafybeib65t37t2tagukok4m7f5rldfirzb5ykvdq3yqbwnbcrtllpggg6u\",\n        \"title\": \"Apollo42 #01 #4\",\n        ...\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n  ```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis section of the NEAR Protocol documentation provides a clear and structured way for users to check their token balances through the command line. The commands are designed to be straightforward, allowing developers and users to easily interact with their accounts and understand their holdings across different token types. The use of `now` allows for real-time balance checking, while alternate parameters like `at-block-height` or `at-block-hash` allow for historical queries if needed."}]}

Let's break down the key components of this code snippet for clarity.\n\n### Overview\n\nThe code snippet is a series of tuples, each containing two formatted strings. The first string represents a command that can be executed in a shell (the NEAR CLI), while the second string represents a corresponding internal representation of that command that could be used programmatically in the NEAR ecosystem.\n\n### Key Components\n\n1. **Command Structure**:\n   - Each command uses the `near call` command to invoke the `flip_coin` function on the `contract.testnet`.\n   - The commands are designed to be executed with various configurations/settings, such as different account aliases or signing methods.\n\n2. **Formatting**:\n   - The `format!` macro is used to create dynamic strings. It allows for embedding variables like `json_args`, `base64_args`, or aliases into the command string.\n   - `USE_ACCOUNT_ALIASES` and `SIGN_WITH_LEDGER_ALIASES` are likely arrays or vectors that hold different account aliases or configurations for signing transactions.\n\n3. **Gas and Deposit**:\n   - Each command specifies `prepaid-gas '30 Tgas'`, meaning that the transaction is allowed to use up to 30 Teragas of gas.\n   - The `attached-deposit '0 NEAR'` indicates that no NEAR tokens are being attached to the transaction.\n\n4. **Signing Mechanisms**:\n   - The commands include options for signing the transaction as `bob.testnet`, which is likely the account of the user executing the command.\n   - Some commands specify the use of a Ledger hardware wallet for signing (`sign-with-ledger`), indicating that the system supports both software and hardware wallet interactions.\n\n5. **Base64 Arguments**:\n   - One command uses the `--base64` flag, suggesting that it can accept arguments encoded in base64 format, which is useful for passing complex data structures.\n\n### Code Snippet Breakdown\n\nHere’s a breakdown of one of the command tuples for clarity:\n\n```rust\n(\n    format!(\"near call contract.testnet flip_coin '{json_args}' --{} bob.testnet\", USE_ACCOUNT_ALIASES[3]),\n    format!(\"contract call-function as-transaction contract.testnet flip_coin json-args '{json_args}' prepaid-gas '30 Tgas' attached-deposit '0 NEAR' sign-as bob.testnet network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send\")\n)\n```\n\n- **First String**:\n  - `near call contract.testnet flip_coin '{json_args}' --{} bob.testnet`\n    - This is the command that would be run in a shell environment.\n    - It calls the `flip_coin` function on `contract.testnet` with `json_args` as the input and uses an alias from `USE_ACCOUNT_ALIASES[3]`.\n\n- **Second String**:\n  - `contract call-function as-transaction contract.testnet flip_coin json-args '{json_args}' prepaid-gas '30 Tgas' attached-deposit '0 NEAR' sign-as bob.testnet network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send`\n    - This string is a programmatic representation of the same action.\n    - It specifies the same parameters but is structured for internal use, possibly within a testing framework or another part of the NEAR ecosystem.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis code snippet is part of a larger testing or command generation system for interacting with NEAR smart contracts. It provides a flexible way to construct commands for invoking contract functions, accommodating different account configurations and signing methods. Understanding this structure is essential for developers looking to interact programmatically with NEAR smart contracts or to extend this functionality within their applications."}]}

Below is a detailed explanation of the various sections of the snippet:\n\n### Overview\n\nThe document is structured as a Markdown file that introduces the concept of locking the auction contract, providing a secure way to handle the auction funds. Locking the contract means removing access keys that could otherwise allow unauthorized access to the funds or the ability to modify the contract.\n\n### Key Sections Explained\n\n#### 1. **Introduction to Locking the Contract**\n```markdown\nIn the basic contract, the auctioneer would claim the tokens from the final bid of the contract via logging into the contract accounts wallet using a key. It is a security issue for there to exist a key for a smart contract since the key holder can take the funds from the contract at any point, maliciously change the contract or just delete the contract as a whole.\n```\n- This section explains the inherent security risks of having access keys associated with a smart contract. If a key exists, it can be exploited by anyone who possesses it, potentially leading to loss of funds or manipulation of the contract.\n\n#### 2. **Locking Mechanism**\n```markdown\nTo stop exploitation we will [lock](../../1.concepts/protocol/access-keys.md#locked-accounts) the contract by removing all access keys and implementing a new method to `claim` the tokens.\n```\n- The aim is to eliminate access keys and instead implement a method (`claim`) that allows the auctioneer to securely claim the funds after the auction concludes.\n\n#### 3. **Adding an Auctioneer**\n```markdown\nWhen we introduce the `claim` method we want to make sure that the individual or entity that set up the auction receives the $NEAR tokens. To do this we now change the `init` method to initialize the contract with an `auctioneer`.\n```\n- The introduction of the `auctioneer` ensures that only the person who set up the auction can claim the funds. The `init` method will now accept parameters to initialize the contract with an auctioneer's account.\n\n#### 4. **Code Tabs for Implementing Changes**\n```markdown\n<Tabs groupId=\"code-tabs\">\n    <TabItem value=\"js\" label=\"🌐 JavaScript\">\n        <Github fname=\"contract.ts\" language=\"javascript\"\n                url=\"https://github.com/near-examples/auctions-tutorial/blob/main/contract-ts/02-owner-claims-money/src/contract.ts#L17-L21\"\n                start=\"17\" end=\"21\" />\n    </TabItem>\n    <TabItem value=\"rust\" label=\"🦀 Rust\">\n        <Github fname=\"lib.rs\" language=\"rust\"\n                url=\"https://github.com/near-examples/auctions-tutorial/blob/main/contract-rs/02-owner-claims-money/src/lib.rs#L25-L35\"\n                start=\"25\" end=\"35\" />\n    </TabItem>\n</Tabs>\n```\n- The `Tabs` component is used to display code snippets for both JavaScript and Rust implementations. Using GitHub links, developers can navigate to the relevant portions of the code to see how the `auctioneer` is integrated.\n\n#### 5. **Claim Method Implementation**\n```markdown\nThe `claim` method should only be callable when the auction is over, can only be executed once and should transfer the tokens to the auctioneer.\n```\n- This section outlines the requirements for the `claim` method, emphasizing security. The method ensures that the funds can only be claimed after the auction ends and only once, preventing double claims.\n\n#### 6. **Updating Tests**\n```markdown\nIf we update our contract then we should update our tests accordingly. For example, the tests will now need to add `auctioneer` to the arguments of `init`.\n```\n- As the contract logic changes, the associated tests must also be updated to ensure that they validate the new functionality, including the expected behavior of the `claim` method.\n\n#### 7. **Deploying and Locking**\n```markdown\nNow that we have the `claim` method, we can deploy the contract without keys. Later, we will introduce a factory contract that deploys auctions to a locked account, but for now, we can manually remove the keys using the CLI to lock the account.\n```\n- This final section instructs developers on how to deploy the updated contract securely. It emphasizes the importance of locking the contract after deployment to prevent any unauthorized access.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe document provides a comprehensive guide to enhancing the security of an auction contract on the NEAR Protocol by introducing a method for claiming funds and removing access keys. This approach mitigates the risks associated with key management and ensures that funds are securely managed. Each section is designed to provide clarity and direct developers on how to implement the necessary changes."}]}

These accounts will be used to interact with the deployed contracts.\n\n### Testing the JavaScript Contract\n```javascript\ntest(\"JS highlevel collection contract\", async (t) => {\n  const { bob, highlevelContract } = t.context.accounts; // Retrieve accounts from context\n\n  // Call the 'set' method of the JavaScript contract with different key-value pairs\n  let r = await bob.callRaw(highlevelContract, \"set\", {\n    key: \"a\".repeat(100),\n    value: \"b\".repeat(100),\n  });\n  r = await bob.callRaw(highlevelContract, \"set\", {\n    key: \"b\".repeat(100),\n    value: \"c\".repeat(100),\n  });\n  r = await bob.callRaw(highlevelContract, \"set\", {\n    key: \"c\".repeat(100),\n    value: \"d\".repeat(100),\n  });\n\n  // Check that the result of the last operation is successful\n  t.is(r.result.status.SuccessValue, \"\"); // Expecting a successful transaction with no return value\n  logGasDetail(r, t); // Log gas details for the transaction\n});\n```\n- **Testing phase**: This test checks the functionality of the JavaScript implementation of the high-level collection contract by calling its `set` method multiple times with different keys and values.\n- **callRaw**: This method invokes a smart contract method on behalf of the user (`bob`), sending the provided arguments.\n- **Assertions**: The test asserts that the `SuccessValue` of the result is an empty string, indicating success. It also logs the gas details for performance analysis.\n\n### Testing the Rust Contract\n```javascript\ntest(\"RS highlevel collection contract\", async (t) => {\n  const { bob, highlevelContractRs } = t.context.accounts; // Retrieve accounts from context\n\n  // Call the 'set' method of the Rust contract with different key-value pairs\n  let r = await bob.callRaw(highlevelContractRs, \"set\", {\n    key: \"a\".repeat(100),\n    value: \"b\".repeat(100),\n  });\n  r = await bob.callRaw(highlevelContractRs, \"set\", {\n    key: \"b\".repeat(100),\n    value: \"c\".repeat(100),\n  });\n  r = await bob.callRaw(highlevelContractRs, \"set\", {\n    key: \"c\".repeat(100),\n    value: \"d\".repeat(100),\n  });\n\n  // Check that the result of the last operation is successful\n  t.is(r.result.status.SuccessValue, \"\"); // Expecting a successful transaction with no return value\n  logGasDetail(r, t); // Log gas details for the transaction\n});\n```\n- **Similar to the previous test**: This test evaluates the Rust implementation of the high-level collection contract. It performs the same sequence of operations as the previous test to ensure consistent behavior across both contract implementations.\n\n### Summary\nOverall, this code snippet sets up an environment to test two implementations of a high-level collection contract. It deploys both contracts, creates user accounts, and performs a series of calls to the `set` method, asserting successful execution and logging gas details for performance insights. The use of `ava` allows the tests to run concurrently, improving testing efficiency."}]}

In this section, we will show you how to create a simple testnet account, deploy the contract and interact with it from the CLI.\n\n:::info Networks\n\nNEAR has two main networks for you to use: `testnet` and `mainnet`. The `testnet` network behaves exactly as the main network, but uses test tokens with no real value\n\n:::\n\n---\n\n## Testnet Account\n\nTo deploy a contract, you need a testnet account. If you don't have one, you can create one using the following command:\n\n```bash\n# create-account using near-cli (contractId has end with .testnet)\nnear create <contractId> --useFaucet\n```\n\nReplace `<contractId>` with the name you want to give to your account, and make sure it ends with `.testnet`.\n\nThe account will be created with **10 NEAR** (these are test tokens).\n\n:::info Testnet Faucet\n\nNotice that we are using the `--useFaucet` flag to automatically request test tokens from the NEAR faucet. \n\nThe faucet is only available on the testnet network - which is the default network for the CLI\n\n:::\n\n---\n\n## Deploying the Contract\n\nTo deploy the contract, you need to compile the contract code into WebAssembly (WASM) and then deploy it to the network\n\n<Tabs groupId=\"code-tabs\">\n\n    <TabItem value=\"js\" label=\"🌐 JavaScript\">\n\n    ```bash\n    # compile the contract\n    npm run build\n\n    # deploy the contract\n    near deploy <contractId> ./build/auction.wasm\n\n    # initialize the contract, it finishes in 2 minutes\n    MINUTE_FROM_NOW=$(date -v+2M +%s000000000)\n    near call <contractId> init '{\"end_time\": \"'$MINUTE_FROM_NOW'\"}' --accountId <contractId>\n    ```\n\n    </TabItem>\n\n    <TabItem value=\"rust\" label=\"🦀 Rust\">\n\n    ```bash\n    # compile the contract using cargo-near\n    cargo near build\n\n    # deploy the contract\n    near deploy <contractId> ./target/near/contract_rs.wasm\n\n    # initialize the contract, it finishes in 2 minutes\n    MINUTE_FROM_NOW=$(date -v+2M +%s000000000)\n    near call <contractId> init '{\"end_time\": \"'$MINUTE_FROM_NOW'\"}' --accountId <contractId>\n    ```\n\n    </TabItem>\n\n</Tabs>\n\n\nNow that the contract is deployed and initialized we can send transactions to it using the CLI. \n\n:::tip Interactive CLI\nNEAR's CLI is interactive meaning you can type `near` and click through all the possible options without having to remember certain commands\n:::\n\n---\n\n## Interacting with the Contract\nWe are now ready to start bidding by calling the `bid` function on the contract. We recommend you to create **two new accounts** to simulate different bidders.\n\n```bash\n# call the contract to bid \nnear call <contractId> bid --accountId <bidderId> --amount 1\n\n# get the highest bid\nnear view <contractId> get_highest_bid\n```\n\nNotice that we call the `bid` function without arguments, but attach 1 NEAR to the transaction. This is the amount we are bidding.\n\nFor the `get_highest_bid` function, we don't need to specify which user is calling it, as it is a view function and does not require gas to be executed.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion \n\nWe have now seen how to deploy a contract to `testnet` and interact with it using the NEAR CLI.\n\nA word of advice before moving forward. When people learn how to use the CLI, they get lazy and start testing new contract features directly on the testnet. While this is tempting, it is not recommended.\n\nDo not use testnet as your **only way** to test contracts. Always test your contracts on the **sandbox environment first**, and only deploy to the testnet when you are confident that everything is working as expected.\n\n:::tip Frontend\n\nGenerally you will use the CLI only to deploy and initialize the contract. After, all interactions will be made from a frontend\n\nWe will cover this topic in the future, after we have finished adding more features to the auction contract\n\n:::```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This code snippet is part of a documentation file for deploying a simple auction smart contract on the NEAR Protocol's testnet. Below, I will break down the main components and explanations present in the snippet to clarify its functionality and purpose.\n\n### Overview\n\nThe document guides users through the process of deploying a smart contract on the NEAR testnet, highlighting the steps necessary to create an account, deploy the contract, initialize it, and interact with it using the NEAR Command Line Interface (CLI).\n\n### Key Components\n\n1. **Metadata and Imports**\n   ```markdown\n   ---\n   id: deploy\n   title: Deploying to Testnet\n   ---\n   ```\n   Here, the document is structured with metadata, specifying the ID and title for easy referencing within a larger documentation framework (like a React application). \n\n   ```javascript\n   import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';\n   import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';\n   import {Github, Language} from \"@site/src/components/codetabs\"\n   ```\n   These lines import components for rendering tabs (for showing different code examples) and GitHub-related features from the documentation site.\n\n2. **Testnet Explanation**\n   The snippet emphasizes that NEAR has two primary networks: `testnet` and `mainnet`. The testnet allows users to deploy and interact with contracts using test tokens that hold no real monetary value, making it a safe environment for experimentation.\n\n3. **Creating a Testnet Account**\n   ```bash\n   near create <contractId> --useFaucet\n   ```\n   This command creates a new testnet account with the specified `<contractId>`, which must end with `.testnet`. The `--useFaucet` flag allows the user to receive 10 NEAR test tokens automatically from the NEAR faucet.\n\n4. **Deploying the Contract**\n   The document provides two code snippets to compile and deploy the contract, one using JavaScript and the other using Rust.\n   - **JavaScript:**\n     ```bash\n     npm run build\n     near deploy <contractId> ./build/auction.wasm\n     ```\n   - **Rust:**\n     ```bash\n     cargo near build\n     near deploy <contractId> ./target/near/contract_rs.wasm\n     ```\n   In both cases, after deploying the contract, the `init` function is called to initialize it with an `end_time`. This is set to two minutes from the current time using a shell command to get the timestamp.\n\n5. **Interacting with the Contract**\n   After deployment, the document outlines how to interact with the contract by placing bids:\n   ```bash\n   near call <contractId> bid --accountId <bidderId> --amount 1\n   near view <contractId> get_highest_bid\n   ```\n   - The `bid` function is called with a specified amount of NEAR, representing the bid.\n   - The `get_highest_bid` function is a view function that allows users to check the highest bid without incurring gas fees.\n\n6. **Concluding Remarks**\n   The document advises against relying solely on the testnet for testing smart contracts. It emphasizes the importance of using a sandbox environment for initial testing before deploying to the testnet.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis code snippet is a comprehensive guide for developers looking to deploy an auction smart contract on the NEAR testnet. It covers account creation, contract deployment, initialization, and interaction through the CLI. The use of tabs to separate code for JavaScript and Rust enhances clarity, allowing developers to follow along with their preferred programming language. The documentation emphasizes best practices, such as thorough testing in a sandbox environment before deployment to the testnet."}]}

Let's break it down step by step:\n\n### Code Explanation\n\n```bash\nnear view v2.ref-finance.near get_deposits '{\"account_id\": \"bob.near\"}'\n```\n\n1. **`near view`**:\n   - This command is used to query (or \"view\") state from a smart contract without making a state-changing transaction. It allows you to read data from the blockchain.\n\n2. **`v2.ref-finance.near`**:\n   - This specifies the smart contract that you are querying. In this case, it's the `v2.ref-finance` contract deployed on the NEAR blockchain. The `.near` suffix indicates that it is an account on the NEAR network.\n\n3. **`get_deposits`**:\n   - This is the method being called on the `v2.ref-finance` smart contract. It is expected to return the deposit balances associated with the account provided in the input.\n\n4. **`'{\"account_id\": \"bob.near\"}'`**:\n   - This is the argument being passed to the `get_deposits` method in JSON format. It specifies the `account_id` for which you want to retrieve deposit information. In this example, the account ID is `bob.near`.\n\n### Example Response\n\nThe expected output of this command, as provided in the example, is a JSON object that shows the deposit balances of the specified account.\n\n```bash\n{\n  'token.v2.ref-finance.near': '0',\n  'wrap.near': \"0\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Response Breakdown:\n\n1. **`'token.v2.ref-finance.near': '0'`**:\n   - This indicates that the account `bob.near` has a deposit balance of `0` for the token associated with the `v2.ref-finance` contract. The token is likely a fungible token managed by the contract.\n\n2. **`'wrap.near': \"0\"`**:\n   - Similarly, this shows that the account `bob.near` has a deposit balance of `0` for the wrapped NEAR token (often abbreviated as \"wrap\"). Wrapped NEAR is a tokenized version of NEAR that is used in various DeFi applications.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis command is useful for developers and users who want to check the deposit balances for an account within a decentralized finance (DeFi) application on the NEAR blockchain. By interacting with the smart contract in this way, you can easily retrieve and monitor account-specific data without making any changes to the blockchain state."}]}

It demonstrates how to query the details of NFTs from different projects (like NFT Primitive, Paras, and Mintbase) and presents example responses in a structured manner. Below is a breakdown of the key components of the code snippet:\n\n### Code Explanation\n\n1. **Tabs and TabItem Components**: \n   - The code uses `Tabs` and `TabItem` components from a UI library (likely React) to organize content into tabs. Each `TabItem` represents a separate tab, allowing users to switch between different NFT contract queries.\n\n   ```javascript\n   import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';\n   import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';\n   ```\n\n2. **Tabs Structure**: \n   - The `Tabs` component has a `groupId` attribute for accessibility, and a class for styling.\n   - Each `TabItem` has a `value`, `label`, and can be marked as `default` to indicate which tab is shown initially.\n\n   ```javascript\n   <Tabs groupId=\"nft-contract-tabs\" className=\"file-tabs\">\n   ```\n\n3. **Querying NFT Tokens**: \n   - Within each `TabItem`, there are examples of NEAR CLI commands that are used to view NFT tokens. The command format is as follows:\n\n   ```bash\n   near view <contract_name> nft_token '{\"token_id\": \"<token_id>\"}'\n   ```\n\n   - This command retrieves details about a specific NFT token using the `nft_token` method of the specified contract.\n\n4. **Example Responses**:\n   - Each tab includes an example response to the command, formatted as a JSON object. This JSON response contains various attributes relevant to the NFT, such as `token_id`, `owner_id`, and `metadata`.\n\n   - **Metadata Fields**: The `metadata` object includes fields such as:\n     - `title`: Name of the NFT.\n     - `description`: A description of the NFT.\n     - `media`: URL to the media associated with the NFT.\n     - `issued_at`, `expires_at`, `starts_at`, `updated_at`: Timestamps for various stages of the NFT's lifecycle.\n     - `reference` and `reference_hash`: Additional data storage for the NFT.\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"token_id\": \"1\",\n     \"owner_id\": \"bob.near\",\n     ...\n     \"metadata\": {\n       \"title\": \"string\",\n       \"description\": \"string\",\n       ...\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n### Sample TabItem Breakdown\n\n#### NFT Primitive Tab\n```javascript\n<TabItem value=\"NFT Primitive\" label=\"Reference\" default>\n```\n- This tab shows how to query the NFT Primitive contract. The sample command and response illustrate how to fetch the details of a token with ID \"1\".\n\n#### Paras Tab\n```javascript\n<TabItem value=\"Paras\" label=\"Paras\">\n```\n- Here, the command queries the Paras NFT contract for a specific token ID. The example response shows the metadata and additional fields like `approved_account_ids`.\n\n#### Mintbase Tab\n```javascript\n<TabItem value=\"Mintbase\" label=\"Mintbase\">\n```\n- Similar to the other tabs, this one queries the Mintbase contract and includes additional fields like `royalty` details, indicating the distribution of royalties for the NFT.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis snippet serves as a user-friendly guide for developers on how to interact with different NFT contracts on the NEAR blockchain. By providing both the commands and expected responses, it helps developers understand how to retrieve NFT data effectively. The use of tabs enhances readability and organization, making it easier to navigate between different NFT ecosystems."}]}

But it is pretty straightforward and follows well-defined rules. In this article, we are going to have a closer look at how the data flows in NEAR Protocol blockchain.\n\nIn fact, any blockchain flow can be represented as an infinity timeline that has a start but has no end.\n\n\n![Blocks Timeline](/docs/flow/01-timeline.png)\n\n\nAnd a block appears on that timeline with some interval. Each of these blocks holds the information about the previous one, thus, creating a *chain of blocks*.\n\n\nNEAR Protocol has a sharded nature, meaning that more than one parallel network, called a [Shard](../../2.build/6.data-infrastructure/lake-data-structures/shard.mdx), can be live at any moment. And each Shard produces a chunk of a block at a given interval. A Block in NEAR Blockchain is a collection of the block chunks from all shards. Block chunk is shortened to [Chunk](../../2.build/6.data-infrastructure/lake-data-structures/chunk.mdx) in NEAR Protocol documentation.\n\nReturning to the data flow itself. The best we can do is to imagine tracks like we could see in audio/video editing apps. Each Shard has its own set of tracks. The top track is for Chunks. They appear no matter what at a given interval, for NEAR Blockchain the interval is about one second. Chunks are being produced even if nothing is happening on the blockchain.\n\n![Timeline as tracks](/docs/flow/02-tracks.png)\n\nBut what do we mean by saying something is happening? We mean that something has triggered some changes in the blockchain. And the most well-known method to trigger any changes is to send a [Transaction](../../2.build/6.data-infrastructure/lake-data-structures/transaction.mdx) to the blockchain with instructions of what we want to change and who has requested those changes.\n\nA transaction needs to be constructed, signed and sent to the blockchain. Once it is executed we expect to have a result - [ExecutionOutcome](../../2.build/6.data-infrastructure/lake-data-structures/execution_outcome.mdx). Oh, that is simple. But it’s not really accurate for NEAR Blockchain.\n\n![Transaction execution](/docs/flow/03-tx-outcome-receipt.png)\n\nIn the beginning there is a [Transaction](../../2.build/6.data-infrastructure/lake-data-structures/transaction.mdx), it contains instructions we want to be executed on the blockchain. Transaction is sent to NEAR Blockchain.\n\nAnd yes, it is executed there immediately BUT the immediate result of the transaction execution is always just *an acknowledgement that it will be executed on the chain;* this internal execution request is known as [Receipt](../../2.build/6.data-infrastructure/lake-data-structures/receipt.mdx). You can think of the [Receipt](../../2.build/6.data-infrastructure/lake-data-structures/receipt.mdx) as an internal transaction that exists to pass information across shards.\n\nLet’s get back to the tracks to look at the example.\n\nAssuming we have two accounts living on different [Shards](../../2.build/6.data-infrastructure/lake-data-structures/shard.mdx) **alice.near** and **bob.near**. **alice.near** creates a [Transaction](../../2.build/6.data-infrastructure/lake-data-structures/transaction.mdx) to send a few tokens to **bob.near**. The [Transaction](../../2.build/6.data-infrastructure/lake-data-structures/transaction.mdx) is immediately executed and the [ExecutionOutcome](../../2.build/6.data-infrastructure/lake-data-structures/execution_outcome.mdx) for the [Transaction](../../2.build/6.data-infrastructure/lake-data-structures/transaction.mdx) is always a [Receipt](../../2.build/6.data-infrastructure/lake-data-structures/receipt.mdx).\n\nBut this [Receipt](../../2.build/6.data-infrastructure/lake-data-structures/receipt.mdx) cannot be executed here, because **bob.near** doesn’t live on the same Shard as **alice.near**, so **the Receipt must be executed on the receiver’s Shard**. So the Receipt is```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The provided code snippet is a Markdown document that outlines the data flow in the NEAR Protocol blockchain. It includes several sections such as an introduction, an embedded video, and a detailed explanation of how data is processed and flows within the NEAR ecosystem. Below is a breakdown of the key components of this document:\n\n### Structure of the Document\n\n1. **Metadata Section**:\n    ```markdown\n    ---\n    sidebar_label: \"NEAR Data Flow\"\n    ---\n    ```\n   - This section contains metadata for the documentation, which could be used for rendering in a sidebar or navigation structure.\n\n2. **Embedded Video**:\n    ```html\n    <iframe\n     width=\"100%\"\n     height=\"500\"\n     src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VSBJ-A69Km4\"\n     title=\"YouTube video player\"\n     frameborder=\"0\"\n     allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n     allowfullscreen>\n    </iframe>\n    ```\n   - An iframe is used to embed a YouTube video that explains the data flow in NEAR Protocol. This enhances the learning experience by providing a visual and auditory element.\n\n3. **Informational Note**:\n    ```markdown\n    :::info Data flow\n    In this video we give a quick overview on the main concept of how the data flows across the NEAR Protocol blockchain.\n    :::\n    ```\n   - This is a callout box that provides a brief description of the video content, helping readers understand the context.\n\n4. **Main Content**:\n   - The document explains the concept of data flow in NEAR, emphasizing its sharded architecture and the sequential nature of block production.\n   - Blocks are produced at intervals (approximately every second) and each block contains chunks from various shards.\n   - The analogy of audio/video editing tracks is used to visualize how data flows through the shards.\n\n5. **Transactions and Receipts**:\n    - The document describes how transactions are created, signed, and sent to the blockchain. \n    - It clarifies that the immediate result of a transaction execution is an acknowledgment in the form of a receipt.\n    - Receipts are essential for inter-shard communication, especially when accounts are located on different shards. For example, if **alice.near** sends tokens to **bob.near**, the receipt generated must be executed on **bob.near's** shard.\n\n### Key Concepts Explained\n\n- **Sharded Architecture**: NEAR Protocol employs a sharded architecture allowing multiple parallel chains (shards) to operate, enhancing scalability.\n  \n- **Block and Chunk**: A block in NEAR is a collection of chunks produced by different shards. This design allows for efficient and parallel processing of transactions.\n\n- **Transactions**: A transaction consists of instructions that modify the state of the blockchain. It is the primary way to trigger changes within the blockchain.\n\n- **ExecutionOutcome and Receipt**: Upon executing a transaction, NEAR returns an `ExecutionOutcome`, which is essentially a receipt indicating that the transaction request has been acknowledged. However, the actual execution of the receipt may need to happen in another shard.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis document serves as an educational resource for understanding the intricacies of data flow within the NEAR Protocol. It emphasizes the unique aspects of NEAR's architecture, such as sharding and the transaction lifecycle.

Here's a breakdown of the components in the code to help you understand its structure and functionality.\n\n### Imports and Module Declaration\n\n```rust\nuse strum::{EnumDiscriminants, EnumIter, EnumMessage};\n\nmod call_function_type;\n```\n- The `strum` crate is used for creating enumerations with additional capabilities such as deriving discriminants and iterators.\n- The `call_function_type` module is declared, which likely contains related definitions for handling function calls.\n\n### Enum Definition: `InitializeMode`\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Debug, Clone, EnumDiscriminants, interactive_clap_derive::InteractiveClap)]\n#[interactive_clap(context = super::ContractFileContext)]\n#[strum_discriminants(derive(EnumMessage, EnumIter))]\n/// Select the need for initialization:\npub enum InitializeMode {\n    /// Add an initialize\n    #[strum_discriminants(strum(message = \"with-init-call     -

`WithInitCall`: Indicates that an initialization function should be added, taking a `CallFunctionAction` as an argument.\n  - `WithoutInitCall`: Indicates no initialization function will be added, representing this with a `NoInitialize` struct.\n- The `interactive_clap` attributes allow this enum to be used in interactive command-line interfaces, utilizing the context from `ContractFileContext`.\n- The `strum_discriminants` attributes enable the generation of enumerated messages and iterable capabilities.\n\n### Struct Definition: `NoInitialize`\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Debug, Clone, interactive_clap::InteractiveClap)]\n#[interactive_clap(input_context = super::ContractFileContext)]\n#[interactive_clap(output_context = NoInitializeContext)]\npub struct NoInitialize {\n    #[interactive_clap(named_arg)]\n    /// Select network\n    network_config: crate::network_for_transaction::NetworkForTransactionArgs,\n}\n```\n- The `NoInitialize` struct is defined to capture the network configuration if the user chooses not to add an initialization function.\n- It leverages `interactive_clap` to enable command-line interaction and includes a field for `network_config`, which is presumably related to transaction networking.\n\n### Context Struct: `NoInitializeContext`\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Debug, Clone)]\npub struct NoInitializeContext(super::ContractFileContext);\n\nimpl NoInitializeContext {\n    pub fn from_previous_context(\n        previous_context: super::ContractFileContext,\n        _scope: &<NoInitialize as interactive_clap::ToInteractiveClapContextScope>::InteractiveClapContextScope,\n    ) -> color_eyre::eyre::Result<Self> {\n        Ok(Self(super::ContractFileContext {\n            global_context: previous_context.global_context,\n            receiver_account_id: previous_context.receiver_account_id,\n            signer_account_id: previous_context.signer_account_id,\n            code: previous_context.code,\n        }))\n    }\n}\n```\n- `NoInitializeContext` wraps around `ContractFileContext` to provide a specific context when no initialization is performed.\n- The `from_previous_context` method creates a new instance of `NoInitializeContext` from an existing `ContractFileContext`, maintaining relevant state information.\n\n### Conversion Implementation: From `NoInitializeContext` to `ActionContext`\n\n```rust\nimpl From<NoInitializeContext> for crate::commands::ActionContext {\n    fn from(item: NoInitializeContext) -> Self {\n        let get_prepopulated_transaction_after_getting_network_callback: crate::commands::GetPrepopulatedTransactionAfterGettingNetworkCallback =\n            std::sync::Arc::new({\n                let signer_account_id = item.0.signer_account_id.clone();\n                let receiver_account_id = item.0.receiver_account_id.clone();\n\n                move |_network_config| {\n                    Ok(crate::commands::PrepopulatedTransaction {\n                        signer_id: signer_account_id.clone(),\n                        receiver_id: receiver_account_id.clone(),\n                        actions: vec![near_primitives::transaction::Action::DeployContract(\n                            near_primitives::transaction::DeployContractAction {\n                                code: item.0.code.clone(),\n                            },\n                        )],\n                    })\n                }\n            });\n\n        Self {\n            global_context: item.0.global_context,\n            interacting_with_account_ids: vec![\n                item.0.signer_account_id,\n                item.0.receiver_account_id,\n            ],\n            get_prepopulated_transaction_after_getting_network_callback,\n            on_before_signing_callback: std::sync::Arc::new(\n                |_prepolulated_unsinged_transaction, _network_config| Ok(()),\n            ),\n            on_before_sending_transaction_callback: std::sync::Arc::new(\n                |_signed_transaction, _network_config| Ok(String::new()),\n            ),\n            on_after_sending_transaction_callback: std::sync::Arc::new(\n                |_outcome_view, _network_config| Ok(()),\n            ),\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n- This implementation allows `NoInitializeContext` to be converted into an `ActionContext`, which is likely used for executing actions related to NEAR transactions.\n- The `get_prepopulated_transaction_after_getting_network_callback` closure is created to generate a prepopulated transaction for deploying the contract with the provided code.\n- Several callback functions are defined (for signing, sending, etc.), ensuring that the necessary actions can be performed at different stages of the transaction lifecycle.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis code snippet sets up an interactive command-line interface for deploying smart contracts on the NEAR blockchain, providing flexibility in initialization mode. By using enums and structured contexts, it supports user input and manages the state effectively throughout the deployment process. The use of `strum` and `interactive_clap` enhances the usability of the command-line interface."}]}

This snippet mainly consists of comments and some metadata for JavaScript modules. Let's break down the components of this code:\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n1. **\"use strict\";**:\n   - This directive enables strict mode in JavaScript, which helps catch common coding errors and \"unsafe\" actions such as defining global variables unintentionally.\n\n2. **Object.defineProperty**:\n   - This is a JavaScript method used to define a new property on an object or modify an existing property. In this case, it is used to set the `__esModule` property on the `exports` object to `true`. This is often done in modules to indicate that the file is an ES module.\n\n   ```javascript\n   Object.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", { value: true });\n   ```\n\n3. **Comment Block**:\n   - The following block is a comment describing unimplemented types related to receipt handling in the NEAR Protocol. The comments are structured in a way that provides context for future developers or maintainers of the code.\n\n   ```javascript\n   /**\n    * Unimplemented types\n\n        /// Postponed Action Receipt.\n        PostponedReceipt(Box<Receipt>),\n        /// Received data from DataReceipt encoded in base64 for the given account_id and data_id.\n        ReceivedData {\n            account_id: AccountId,\n            data_id: CryptoHash,\n            #[serde(with = \"option_base64_format\")]\n            data: Option<Vec<u8>>,\n        },\n        /// Delayed Receipt.\n        /// The receipt was delayed because the shard was overwhelmed.\n        DelayedReceipt(Box<Receipt>),\n    */\n   ```\n\n   - **PostponedReceipt(Box<Receipt>)**:\n     - This indicates a receipt that represents an action that has been postponed. The use of `Box<Receipt>` suggests that this type wraps a `Receipt` object, possibly for memory management or to pass around ownership in Rust-like fashion.\n\n   - **ReceivedData**:\n     - This type seems to describe data that has been received from a `DataReceipt`. It includes:\n       - `account_id`: An identifier for the account.\n       - `data_id`: A cryptographic hash representing the data.\n       - `data`: An optional field that may contain a vector of bytes, encoded in base64. The `#[serde(with = \"option_base64_format\")]` annotation indicates that when serializing or deserializing this field, a specific format for base64 encoding should be used.\n\n   - **DelayedReceipt(Box<Receipt>)**:\n     - This describes a receipt that was delayed due to the shard being overwhelmed, again using a box to manage the `Receipt`.\n\n4. **Source Mapping URL**:\n   - The comment at the end indicates the source mapping file, which helps in debugging by mapping the compiled code back to the original TypeScript source. This is helpful for developers to trace back errors or understand the original code structure.\n\n   ```javascript\n   //# sourceMappingURL=types.js.map\n   ```\n\n### Summary\nThe code snippet provides a definition of unimplemented types that are related to receipt handling in the NEAR Protocol ecosystem. It serves as documentation for future implementations, outlining how these types can be structured and what data they will hold. The use of TypeScript's features, like `Box` and `Option`, reflects a design that is careful about memory management and data handling, which is crucial in blockchain development for efficiency and security."}]}

The transaction is created with the account's signer.\n\n   - **view**:\n     ```rust\n     pub fn view(&self, contract_id: &AccountId, function: &str) -> Query<'_, ViewFunction> {\n         self.worker.view(contract_id, function)\n     }\n     ```\n     - Allows for a view call to a smart contract function, enabling the retrieval of data without changing the state.\n\n   - **transfer_near**:\n     ```rust\n     pub async fn transfer_near(\n         &self,\n         receiver_id: &AccountId,\n         amount: NearToken,\n     ) -> Result<ExecutionFinalResult> {\n         self.worker\n             .transfer_near(self.signer(), receiver_id, amount)\n             .await\n     }\n     ```\n     - Asynchronously transfers NEAR tokens to another account. It uses the worker's method to execute the transfer.\n\n   - **delete_account**:\n     ```rust\n     pub async fn delete_account(self, beneficiary_id: &AccountId) -> Result<ExecutionFinalResult> {\n         self.worker\n             .delete_account(self.id(), &self.signer, beneficiary_id)\n             .await\n     }\n     ```\n     - Deletes the current account and sends its remaining balance to a specified beneficiary.\n\n   - **view_account**:\n     ```rust\n     pub fn view_account(&self) -> Query<'_, ViewAccount> {\n         self.worker.view_account(self.id())\n     }\n     ```\n     - Allows viewing the current account's details, such as balance and storage usage.\n\n   - **view_access_key**:\n     ```rust\n     pub fn view_access_key(&self, pk: &PublicKey) -> Query<'_, ViewAccessKey> {\n         Query::new(\n             self.worker.client(),\n             ViewAccessKey {\n                 account_id: self.id().clone(),\n                 public_key: pk.clone(),\n             },\n         )\n     }\n     ```\n     - Views the access key for the account associated with the provided public key.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis `Account` struct encapsulates the operations a user can perform on their account in the NEAR blockchain, providing methods for creating transactions, querying account states, and interacting with smart contracts. The design emphasizes ease of use while maintaining security through the use of signers for transaction signing."}]}

to validate the functionality of the `providers` in the NEAR ecosystem. It focuses on testing various JSON-RPC queries and their responses. Below is a detailed breakdown of the code:\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n1. **Imports**:\n   ```javascript\n   import { beforeAll, describe, expect, jest, test } from '@jest/globals';\n   import { KeyPair } from '@near-js/crypto';\n   import { ErrorMessages } from '@near-js/utils';\n   import base58 from 'bs58';\n\n   import { createAccount, deployContract, generateUniqueString, setUpTestConnection, sleep, waitFor } from './test-utils';\n   ```\n\n   - The code imports necessary functions and types from Jest for testing, NEAR utilities for cryptographic functions, and helper functions from a `test-utils` module.\n\n2. **Configuration**:\n   ```javascript\n   jest.setTimeout(60000);\n   ```\n\n   - This sets the timeout for each test to 60 seconds, which is useful when dealing with asynchronous operations that may take longer.\n\n3. **Setup**:\n   ```javascript\n   let provider;\n   let near;\n\n   beforeAll(async () => {\n       near = await setUpTestConnection();\n       provider = near.connection.provider;\n   });\n   ```\n\n   - Two variables `provider` and `near` are declared. The `beforeAll` hook initializes a NEAR connection and assigns the provider to the `provider` variable. This setup runs once before all tests in the suite.\n\n4. **Test Suite**:\n   ```javascript\n   describe('providers', () => {\n   ```\n\n   - This defines a test suite named \"providers\".\n\n5. **Individual Tests**:\n   Each `test` block defines an individual test case for various functionalities of the NEAR provider. Here are some highlights:\n\n   - **Transaction Status Tests**:\n     ```javascript\n     test('txStatus with string hash and buffer hash', async () => {\n         const sender = await createAccount(near);\n         const receiver = await createAccount(near);\n         const outcome = await sender.sendMoney(receiver.accountId, 1n);\n         const responseWithString = await provider.txStatus(outcome.transaction.hash, sender.accountId);\n         const responseWithUint8Array = await provider.txStatus(base58.decode(outcome.transaction.hash), sender.accountId);\n         expect(responseWithString).toMatchObject(outcome);\n         expect(responseWithUint8Array).toMatchObject(outcome);\n     });\n     ```\n\n     - This test checks that the transaction status can be retrieved using both string and buffer representations of the transaction hash. It expects both responses to match the original transaction outcome.\n\n   - **Transaction Receipts Tests**:\n     ```javascript\n     test('txStatusReciept with string hash and buffer hash', async () => {\n         // Similar structure to the previous test, checking transaction receipts.\n     });\n     ```\n\n   - **JSON RPC Queries**:\n     ```javascript\n     test('json rpc query account', async () => {\n         const account = await createAccount(near);\n         const response = await provider.query({\n             request_type: 'view_account',\n             finality: 'optimistic',\n             account_id: account.accountId });\n         expect(response.code_hash).toEqual('11111111111111111111111111111111');\n     });\n     ```\n     - This test queries the account information, checking for the expected code hash.\n\n   - **State and Code Queries**:\n     ```javascript\n     test('json rpc query view_state', async () => {\n         const contract = await deployContract(near.accountCreator.masterAccount, generateUniqueString('test'));\n         await contract.setValue({ args: { value: 'hello' } });\n         return waitFor(async () => {\n             const response = await provider.query({\n                 request_type: 'view_state',\n                 finality: 'final',\n                 account_id: contract.contractId,\n                 prefix_base64: ''\n             });\n             expect(response).toEqual({\n                 block_height: expect.any(Number),\n                 block_hash: expect.any(String),\n                 values: [\n                     { key: 'bmFtZQ==', value: 'aGVsbG8=' }\n                 ]\n             });\n         });\n     });\n     ```\n     - This tests querying the state of a contract after setting a value.\n\n6. **Assertions**:\n   - The `expect` statements are used extensively throughout the tests to assert that the actual responses match the expected values, ensuring the functionality behaves as intended.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis code snippet is a comprehensive test suite for the NEAR Protocol's provider functionality. It tests various aspects of JSON-RPC interactions, including transaction status, account queries, and contract state queries. By employing Jest, it ensures that the provider correctly handles both string and binary representations of transaction hashes, validates receipt structures, and checks for expected outcomes in contract interactions. This ensures robustness and reliability in the NEAR Protocol's provider API."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain the following code snippet from NEAR repository file `packages/near-api-js/src/near.ts`:\n```export { Near, NearConfig } from '@near-js/wallet-account';\n```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The provided code snippet is a simple export statement in JavaScript (or TypeScript) that is part of a module in the NEAR API JavaScript library, specifically within the `near.ts` file located in the `packages/near-api-js/src` directory. Let's break it down:\n\n```javascript\nexport { Near, NearConfig } from '@near-js/wallet-account';\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Export Statement**: \n   - The `export` keyword is used to export functions, objects, or primitive values from a module so that they can be imported and used in other modules. This is part of the ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) module syntax.\n\n2. **Destructuring Import**:\n   - The syntax `{ Near, NearConfig }` indicates that two specific entities, `Near` and `NearConfig`, are being exported from another module. This is a form of destructuring that allows you to pick specific exports from a module.\n\n3. **Source Module**:\n   - The `from '@near-js/wallet-account'` part specifies the source module from which `Near` and `NearConfig` are being imported. This module is likely part of the NEAR ecosystem and provides functionality related to wallet accounts.\n\n### Context within NEAR\n\n- **`Near`**: Typically, in the context of the NEAR Protocol, `Near` could refer to a class or function that provides methods for interacting with the NEAR blockchain, such as sending transactions, querying the blockchain state, etc.\n  \n- **`NearConfig`**: This is likely a configuration object or class that contains settings required to initialize the `Near` instance, such as network details, API endpoints, and other parameters that are essential for establishing a connection with the NEAR blockchain.\n\n### Usage\n\nWhen another module imports from `near.ts`, they will have access to both `Near` and `NearConfig` directly. Here’s an example of how this might be used in another module:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Near, NearConfig } from './near';\n\n// Create a configuration object for connecting to NEAR\nconst config: NearConfig = {\n    networkId: 'testnet',\n    nodeUrl: 'https://rpc.testnet.near.org',\n    walletUrl: 'https://wallet.testnet.near.org',\n};\n\n// Instantiate the Near object using the configuration\nconst near = new Near(config);\n```\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, this line of code is exporting two important components from the `@near-js/wallet-account` module, making them available for use in other parts of the NEAR API JS library.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the code:\n\n### Imports\n```typescript\nimport type { ModuleState, Wallet } from \"@near-wallet-selector/core\";\nimport type { HardwareWalletAccountState } from \"../render-modal\";\nimport { modalState } from \"../modal\";\nimport { renderLedgerSelectAccount } from \"./LedgerSelectAccount\";\nimport { renderWalletConnectionFailed } from \"./WalletConnectionFailed\";\nimport { translate } from \"@near-wallet-selector/core\";\nimport { BackArrowIcon } from \"./icons/BackArrowIcon\";\nimport { CloseIcon } from \"./icons/CloseIcon\";\n```\n- **ModuleState, Wallet**: These types are imported from the core wallet selector library, representing the state of the wallet module.\n- **HardwareWalletAccountState**: This type represents the state of accounts managed by the hardware wallet.\n- **modalState**: This likely holds the current state of the modal, including any options or settings.\n- **renderLedgerSelectAccount**: A function to render the selection of Ledger accounts.\n- **renderWalletConnectionFailed**: A function to render an error message if the wallet connection fails.\n- **translate**: A utility function for internationalization, translating messages based on keys.\n- **BackArrowIcon, CloseIcon**: Icon components used in the UI.\n\n### Function Declaration\n```typescript\nexport async function renderLedgerAccountsOverviewList(\n  module: ModuleState<Wallet>,\n  accounts: Array<HardwareWalletAccountState>,\n  selectedAccounts: Array<HardwareWalletAccountState>\n)\n```\n- The function is an async function that takes three parameters:\n  - **module**: The current module state, indicating which wallet is being used.\n  - **accounts**: An array of all available hardware wallet accounts.\n  - **selectedAccounts**: An array of accounts that have been selected by the user.\n\n### Rendering the Modal\nThe following block is responsible for rendering the HTML structure of the modal:\n```typescript\ndocument.querySelector(\".modal-right\")!.innerHTML = `\n  <div class=\"nws-modal-body\">\n    <div class=\"nws-modal-header-wrapper\">\n      <button class=\"back-button\" id=\"back-button\">\n        ${BackArrowIcon}\n      </button>\n      <div class=\"nws-modal-header\">\n        <h3 class=\"middleTitle\">\n          ${translate(\"modal.ledger.connecting\")} ${selectedAccounts.length} ${translate(\"modal.ledger.ofAccounts\")}\n        </h3>\n        <button class=\"close-button\">${CloseIcon}</button>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"derivation-path-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"overview-wrapper\">\n        <p>${translate(\"modal.ledger.overviewTheListOfAuthorized\")}</p>\n        <div class=\"accounts\" id=\"accounts\"></div>\n        <div class=\"action-buttons\">\n          <button class=\"middleButton\" id=\"finish-button\">\n            ${translate(\"modal.ledger.finish\")}\n          </button>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n`;\n```\n- The modal is populated with HTML content that includes:\n  - A back button to navigate to the account selection.\n  - A header displaying the current connecting status with the number of selected accounts.\n  - A div for listing authorized accounts.\n  - A finish button to finalize the connection process.\n\n### Populating Selected Accounts\n```typescript\nfor (let i = 0; i < selectedAccounts.length; i++) {\n  document.getElementById(\"accounts\")?.insertAdjacentHTML(\n    \"beforeend\",\n    `\n      <div>\n        <div class=\"account\">\n          <span>${selectedAccounts[i].accountId}</span>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    `\n  );\n}\n```\n- This loop iterates over the `selectedAccounts` array and appends each account's ID to the `accounts` div in the modal. Each account is wrapped in a div for styling.\n\n### Event Listeners\n#### Back Button\n```typescript\ndocument.getElementById(\"back-button\")?.addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n  renderLedgerSelectAccount(module, accounts);\n});\n```\n- When the back button is clicked, it calls the `renderLedgerSelectAccount` function to go back to the previous state.\n\n#### Finish Button\n```typescript\ndocument\n  .getElementById(\"finish-button\")\n  ?.addEventListener(\"click\", async () => {\n    try {\n      if (!modalState) {\n        return;\n      }\n\n      const wallet = await module.wallet();\n      wallet.signIn({\n        contractId: modalState.options.contractId,\n        methodNames: modalState.options.methodNames,\n        accounts: selectedAccounts,\n      });\n\n      modalState.container.children[0].classList.remove(\"open\");\n      modalState.emitter.emit(\"onHide\", { hideReason: \"wallet-navigation\" });\n    } catch (err) {\n      await renderWalletConnectionFailed(module, err as Error);\n    }\n  });\n```\n- The finish button initiates the sign-in process for the selected accounts.\n- It checks if `modalState` is defined and retrieves the wallet instance.\n- It then calls the `signIn` method on the wallet with necessary parameters like `contractId`, `methodNames`, and `accounts`.\n- If successful, it closes the modal and emits an event indicating the modal was hidden. If there's an error, it calls `renderWalletConnectionFailed` to handle the error.\n\n### Summary\nThis code snippet effectively manages the UI for displaying Ledger accounts in a NEAR wallet selection modal. It handles user interactions, updates the UI dynamically with selected accounts, and manages the sign-in process, ensuring a smooth user experience for connecting hardware wallets."}]}

This code defines an `AccountManager` class and its derived classes `CustomnetManager` and `TestnetManager`. \n\n### Overview of the Code Snippet\n\nThis code is part of a system that manages blockchain accounts, allowing for operations such as checking account existence, executing transactions, and handling account keys. Here's a detailed explanation of the key components:\n\n#### `exists` Method\n\n```typescript\nexists(accountId: string | NearAccount): Promise<boolean> {\n    return this.provider.accountExists(asId(accountId));\n}\n```\n- **Purpose**: Checks if an account exists on the NEAR blockchain.\n- **Parameters**: Accepts either an `accountId` (string) or a `NearAccount` object.\n- **Returns**: A promise that resolves to `true` if the account exists, otherwise `false`.\n\n#### `canCoverBalance` Method\n\n```typescript\nasync canCoverBalance(account: string | NearAccount, amount: BN): Promise<boolean> {\n    return amount.lt(await this.availableBalance(account));\n}\n```\n- **Purpose**: Determines if an account can cover a specified balance.\n- **Parameters**: \n  - `account`: Either an `accountId` (string) or a `NearAccount`.\n  - `amount`: A `BN` (BigNumber) representing the balance to check against.\n- **Returns**: A promise that resolves to `true` if the available balance is greater than the amount; otherwise, `false`.\n\n#### `executeTransaction` Method\n\n```typescript\nasync executeTransaction(tx: Transaction, keyPair?: KeyPair): Promise<TransactionResult> {\n    const account: nearAPI.Account = new nearAPI.Account(this.connection, tx.senderId);\n    let oldKey: KeyPair | null = null;\n    if (keyPair) {\n        oldKey = await this.getKey(account.accountId);\n        await this.setKey(account.accountId, keyPair);\n    }\n\n    try {\n        const start = Date.now();\n        const outcome: FinalExecutionOutcome = await account.signAndSendTransaction({receiverId: tx.receiverId, actions: tx.actions, returnError: true});\n        const end = Date.now();\n        if (oldKey) {\n            await this.setKey(account.accountId, oldKey);\n        } else if (keyPair) {\n            await this.deleteKey(tx.senderId);\n        }\n\n        const result = new TransactionResult(outcome, start, end, this.config);\n        txDebug(result.summary());\n        return result;\n    } catch (error: unknown) {\n        if (oldKey) {\n            await this.setKey(account.accountId, oldKey);\n        }\n\n        if (error instanceof Error) {\n            const key = await this.getPublicKey(tx.receiverId);\n            debug(`TX FAILED: receiver ${tx.receiverId} with key ${key?.toString() ??

It illustrates NEAR's design for modular and extensible account management, allowing for different configurations based on the network being interacted with. Each method is well-defined, ensuring that operations are performed securely and efficiently within the NEAR ecosystem."}]}

This snippet specifically logs different aspects of gas usage for a transaction that involves multiple receipts, which represent the outcomes of contract calls. Here's a breakdown of the code:\n\n```javascript\n// Log the gas used for the second receipt outcome of a cross-contract call\nt.log(\n  \"Gas used for the cross contract call: \",\n  formatGas(r.result.receipts_outcome[1].outcome.gas_burnt)\n);\n\n// Extract and map the gas breakdown for the second receipt outcome\nmap = gasBreakdown(r.result.receipts_outcome[1].outcome);\nlogGasBreakdown(map, t);\n\n// Log the gas used to refund unused gas for the cross contract call\nt.log(\n  \"Gas used to refund unused gas for cross contract call: \",\n  formatGas(r.result.receipts_outcome[2].outcome.gas_burnt)\n);\n\n// Log the gas used to refund unused gas for the entire transaction\nt.log(\n  \"Gas used to refund unused gas: \",\n  formatGas(r.result.receipts_outcome[3].outcome.gas_burnt)\n);\n\n// Log the total gas used across all components of the transaction\nt.log(\n  \"Total gas used: \",\n  formatGas(\n    r.result.transaction_outcome.outcome.gas_burnt + // Gas burnt in the transaction outcome\n    r.result.receipts_outcome[0].outcome.gas_burnt + // Gas burnt in the first receipt outcome\n    r.result.receipts_outcome[1].outcome.gas_burnt + // Gas burnt in the second receipt outcome\n    r.result.receipts_outcome[2].outcome.gas_burnt + // Gas burnt in the unused gas refund for the cross contract call\n    r.result.receipts_outcome[3].outcome.gas_burnt   // Gas burnt in the unused gas refund for the transaction\n  )\n);\n```\n\n### Explanation of Key Components:\n\n1. **Logging Gas Usage**:\n   - The `t.log` method is called multiple times to log different metrics related to gas usage during the transaction. This is crucial for understanding how much gas is consumed by various parts of the execution.\n\n2. **Fetching Gas Burnt**:\n   - `r.result.receipts_outcome[n].outcome.gas_burnt` accesses the gas burnt for each receipt outcome. Each index corresponds to a specific operation within the transaction:\n     - `receipts_outcome[1]` is likely a result of a cross-contract call.\n     - `receipts_outcome[2]` and `receipts_outcome[3]` refer to refunds for unused gas.\n\n3. **Gas Breakdown Mapping**:\n   - The function `gasBreakdown` is called to generate a breakdown of gas usage for the second receipt outcome. This may provide more detailed insights into how gas was utilized within that specific contract call.\n   - `logGasBreakdown(map, t)` logs this detailed breakdown for better visibility.\n\n4. **Total Gas Calculation**:\n   - The total gas used is calculated by summing up the gas burnt from various outcomes, including the initial transaction and all subsequent receipts. This provides an overview of the total resources consumed during the execution of the smart contract calls.\n\n### Importance in NEAR Development:\nUnderstanding gas usage is critical in blockchain development as it directly affects transaction costs and performance.

Let's break down the key components of the snippet and the commands mentioned.\n\n### Understanding the Access Key Snippet\n\nThe first part of the snippet lists several access keys that have been granted full access to a NEAR account. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the format:\n\n```txt\ned25519:<public_key> (nonce: <nonce_value>) is granted to full access\n```\n\n- **ed25519:** This denotes the type of public key being used. In NEAR Protocol, `ed25519` is a widely used algorithm for public-key cryptography.\n  \n- **<public_key>:** This is the actual public key that is associated with an account. It allows the holder of the corresponding private key to interact with the account.\n\n- **(nonce: <nonce_value>):** The nonce is a unique value that helps to ensure that each transaction is unique. It prevents replay attacks by ensuring that a transaction cannot be executed more than once.\n\n- **is granted to full access:** This indicates that the specified public key has been granted \"full access\" permissions, meaning it can perform any action on the account, such as sending NEAR tokens or deploying smart contracts.\n\n### Command to Add Access Keys\n\nNext, the document provides a command to add a new access key to a NEAR account:\n\n```bash\nnear account \\\n    add-key fro_volod.testnet \\\n    grant-full-access \\\n    use-manually-provided-public-key ed25519:75a5ZgVZ9DFTxs4THtFxPtLj7AY3YzpxtapTQBdcMXx3 \\\n    network-config testnet \\\n    sign-with-keychain \\\n    send\n```\n\n#### Breakdown of the Command:\n\n- **near account:** This is the NEAR CLI command to interact with account-related functionalities.\n\n- **add-key fro_volod.testnet:** This specifies that you are adding a key to the account identified by `fro_volod.testnet`.\n\n- **grant-full-access:** This flag indicates that the new access key will have full permissions to the account.\n\n- **use-manually-provided-public-key ed25519:75a5ZgVZ9DFTxs4THtFxPtLj7AY3YzpxtapTQBdcMXx3:** This specifies the public key that you are adding to the account.\n\n- **network-config testnet:** This specifies that you are targeting the NEAR testnet environment.\n\n- **sign-with-keychain:** This indicates that the transaction will be signed using the keychain, ensuring secure signing of transactions.\n\n- **send:** This flag indicates that the command should send the transaction to the NEAR network.\n\n### Result of the Command\n\nAfter executing the command, the output confirms the success of the operation:\n\n```txt\nTransaction sent ...\nSuccessful transaction\nAdded access key = ed25519:75a5ZgVZ9DFTxs4THtFxPtLj7AY3YzpxtapTQBdcMXx3 to fro_volod.testnet.\nTransaction ID: 2oVDKopcWphN3qrUoq7XjFMpRuCUjz6jSU327q8trAQ5\nTo see the transaction in the transaction explorer, please open this url in your browser:\nhttps://explorer.testnet.near.org/transactions/2oVDKopcWphN3qrUoq7XjFMpRuCUjz6jSU327q8trAQ5\n```\n\n### Additional Commands\n\nThe document also suggests modifying parameters to manage access keys differently, such as generating keys automatically or granting function call access instead of full access. \n\n#### Example Command for Functional Access:\n\n```bash\nnear account \\\n    add-key fro_volod.testnet \\\n    grant-function-call-access \\\n```\n\nThis command would allow for more granular control over the permissions associated with the access key, limiting it to function calls rather than full access to the account.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis snippet and the commands provided are fundamental for managing access keys in the NEAR Protocol. Access keys are essential for securing accounts and controlling access to their functionalities. Understanding how to add, manage, and differentiate between full and functional access is crucial for developers working within the NEAR ecosystem."}]}

Let's break it down for clarity:\n\n```bash\nnetwork-config testnet \\\nnow\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Command\n\n1. **network-config testnet**: This part of the command specifies the network configuration to use. In this case, `testnet` indicates that the command will interact with the NEAR TestNet, which is a public test environment for developers to test their dApps and smart contracts without using real assets. TestNet is a safe space for experimentation and development.\n\n2. **now**: This command likely refers to a specific operation that retrieves or displays the current state or status of the account or assets associated with the provided network configuration. While this fragment does not specify what `now` does in detail, it typically indicates an immediate action to fetch the current information.\n\n### Result of the Command\n\nThe result of executing this command provides details about the NFT (Non-Fungible Token) tokens owned by the `fro_volod.testnet` account. Here's a breakdown of the result:\n\n```json\nfro_volod.testnet account has NFT tokens:\n[\n  {\n    \"approved_account_ids\": {},\n    \"metadata\": {\n      \"copies\": 100,\n      \"description\": null,\n      \"expires_at\": null,\n      \"extra\": null,\n      \"issued_at\": \"1657613801537412611\",\n      \"media\": \"bafybeib65t37t2tagukok4m7f5rldfirzb5ykvdq3yqbwnbcrtllpggg6u\",\n      \"media_hash\": null,\n      \"reference\": \"bafkreidmbv4j2qylxc2mngsup7cxakw7gwyd7lu2zycznrdtqw4kc52cwu\",\n      \"reference_hash\": null,\n      \"starts_at\": null,\n      \"title\": \"Apollo42 #01 #4\",\n      \"updated_at\": null\n    },\n    \"owner_id\": \"fro_volod.testnet\",\n    \"token_id\": \"1604:4\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n#### Key Components of the Result:\n\n- **approved_account_ids**: This field is empty, indicating that there are no accounts approved to manage or transfer this NFT on behalf of the owner.\n\n- **metadata**: This structure contains details about the NFT:\n  - **copies**: Total copies of the NFT that exist (100 in this case).\n  - **issued_at**: The timestamp indicating when the NFT was created.\n  - **media**: A reference to the media file associated with the NFT, typically a URL or IPFS hash.\n  - **reference**: A reference hash for additional metadata or related content associated with the NFT.\n  - **title**: The name or title of the NFT.\n\n- **owner_id**: This indicates the account that currently owns the NFT (`fro_volod.testnet`).\n\n- **token_id**: A unique identifier for this specific NFT instance (`1604:4`).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOverall, this command and its output allow developers to interact with the NEAR blockchain, specifically to retrieve information about NFTs associated with a given account on the TestNet. This functionality is crucial for developers building NFT applications, as it provides insight into asset ownership and metadata, which is essential for managing NFTs in decentralized applications. \n\nIf you have further questions about specific parts of the command or its output, feel free to ask!"}]}

Let's break it down into its key components and explain their significance.\n\n### Configuration Settings\n\nThis section of the code defines various configuration parameters for the NEAR Protocol, which govern how the blockchain operates. Below is a summary of the key fields:\n\n- **Gas and Action Limits:**\n  - `max_total_prepaid_gas`: The maximum amount of gas that can be prepaid for a transaction, allowing for a high level of computation within a single transaction.\n  - `max_actions_per_receipt`: Limits the number of actions (like transfers or function calls) that can occur in a single receipt.\n  - `max_length_method_name`: Maximum character length for method names in smart contracts.\n  - `max_arguments_length` and `max_length_returned_data`: Limits on the size of arguments passed to and returned from smart contract methods.\n\n- **Storage Limits:**\n  - `max_contract_size`, `max_length_storage_key`, and `max_length_storage_value`: These define restrictions on the sizes of contracts and their storage keys/values, ensuring efficiency and preventing abuse of storage resources.\n\n- **Promises and Dependencies:**\n  - `max_promises_per_function_call_action`: Limits the number of promises that can be created in a single function call action, ensuring that the system remains manageable and efficient.\n  - `max_number_input_data_dependencies`: Limits the number of dependencies that a particular function can have, which helps manage complexity.\n\n- **Account Creation:**\n  - `min_allowed_top_level_account_length`: Controls the minimum length for creating new top-level accounts, which can affect user account management.\n  - `registrar_account_id`: Specifies the account responsible for account registration.\n\n### Validator Information\n\nThe snippet also includes an array of validators, which are crucial for the operation of a blockchain. Each validator is represented by an object that contains:\n\n- `account_id`: Unique identifier for the validator node.\n- `public_key`: The public key associated with the validator, which is used for cryptographic operations.\n- `amount`: The amount of tokens staked by the validator, which influences their voting power and ability to validate transactions.\n\n### Other Parameters\n\n- **transaction_validity_period**: This indicates the duration a transaction remains valid, set to 86400 seconds (or 24 hours).\n- **protocol_reward_rate**: This is an array that specifies how rewards are distributed within the protocol.\n- **max_inflation_rate**: Defines the maximum inflation rate for the token supply.\n- **total_supply**: The total amount of tokens available in the NEAR ecosystem.\n- **num_blocks_per_year**: Indicates the number of blocks that are expected to be produced in one year, which can be used for time-based calculations.\n- **protocol_treasury_account**: The account designated for protocol treasury operations.\n- **fishermen_threshold**: Minimum amount required for validators (or \"fishermen\") to participate in block validation.\n- **minimum_stake_divisor**: A divisor used to determine the minimum staking requirements for validators.\n\n### Error Handling\n\nThe second part of your code snippet outlines how the NEAR Protocol handles errors in its JSON-RPC API. It follows the `verror` convention for structuring error responses, which includes:\n\n- `error.name`: The type of error encountered.\n- `error.cause`: Detailed cause of the error, which can include additional information.\n- `code`: A numerical error code.\n- `data`: Additional string data about the error.\n- `message`: A descriptive error message.\n\n### Considerations\n\n- The **Heads Up** note clarifies that certain fields (`code`, `data`, `message`) might be deprecated in the future, and developers should not rely on them, indicating potential changes in the API structure.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis code snippet is a part of the NEAR Protocol's configuration and error handling mechanism in its JSON-RPC API. Understanding these settings is crucial for developers working with NEAR to ensure efficient smart contract deployment, transaction handling, and to gracefully manage errors that may arise during API calls."}]}

The document is structured using Markdown syntax and includes code examples for using the NEAR CLI (Command Line Interface) to manage account keys. Let's break down each part of the snippet for clarity:\n\n### Overview of the Document Structure\n\n1. **Front Matter**:\n   ```markdown\n   ---\n   id: lock\n   title: Locking Accounts\n   ---\n   ```\n   - This section is metadata for the document. The `id` is used for referencing this document, and the `title` is what will be displayed as the header.\n\n2. **Imports**:\n   ```markdown\n   import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';\n   import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';\n   ```\n   - These lines import components from a theme library, likely used for rendering tabbed content in a documentation site. `Tabs` creates a tabbed interface, and `TabItem` represents individual tabs.\n\n3. **Introduction of Concept**:\n   ```markdown\n   Removing all [full access keys](../../../4.tools/cli.md#near-delete-key-near-delete-key) from an account will effectively **lock it**.\n   ```\n   - This line explains that an account on the NEAR blockchain can be locked by removing all full access keys. The linked documentation provides further details on how to delete keys.\n\n4. **Effects of Locking**:\n   ```markdown\n   When an account is locked nobody can perform transactions in the account's name (e.g. update the code or transfer money).\n   ```\n   - This line clarifies the implications of locking an account—no transactions can be made with that account, providing a layer of security.\n\n### Instructions on How to Lock an Account\n\nThe document provides two methods for locking an account, represented as tabs for user convenience: **Short** and **Full**.\n\n#### Short Method\n```markdown\n<Tabs groupId=\"cli-tabs\">\n  <TabItem value=\"short\" label=\"Short\">\n\n  ```bash\n  near keys <dev-account>\n  # result: [access_key: {\"nonce\": ..., \"public_key\": '<key>'}]\n\n  near delete-key <dev-account> '<key>'\n  ```\n  </TabItem>\n```\n- In this tab, users are shown a quick way to lock their account:\n  - The command `near keys <dev-account>` retrieves the access keys associated with the account. The result shows the keys, including their nonce and public key.\n  - The command `near delete-key <dev-account> '<key>'` removes the specified key, effectively locking the account.\n\n#### Full Method\n```markdown\n  <TabItem value=\"full\" label=\"Full\">\n\n  ```bash\n  near account list-keys <dev-account> network-config testnet now\n  # result:\n\n  +---+------------+-------+-------------+\n  | # | Public Key | Nonce | Permissions |\n  +---+------------+-------+-------------+\n  ..    '<key>'      ...        ...\n  +---+------------+-------+-------------+\n\n  near account delete-key <dev-account> '<key>' network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send\n  ```\n  </TabItem>\n</Tabs>\n```\n- The full method provides more detailed commands:\n  - The command `near account list-keys <dev-account> network-config testnet now` lists all keys associated with the account, along with their permissions and nonces.\n  - The command `near account delete-key <dev-account> '<key>' network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send` is a more complex command that includes network configuration and specifies permissions for the key being deleted.\n\n### Importance of Locking an Account\n```markdown\n#### Why Locking an Account\n\nLocking an account brings more reassurance to end-users, since they know no external actor will be able to manipulate the account's contract or balance.\n```\n- This section emphasizes the security benefits of locking an account, assuring users that their funds and contract state cannot be changed by unauthorized parties.\n\n### Upgrading Locked Contracts\n```markdown\n:::tip Upgrading Locked Contracts\n\nPlease do note that, while no external actor can update the contract, the contract **can still upgrade itself**. See [this article](upgrade.md#programmatic-update) for details.\n:::\n```\n- A useful tip is provided here, indicating that while external manipulation is not possible when an account is locked, the smart contract itself can still perform upgrades if programmed to do so. This encourages developers to consider self-upgrading mechanisms within their contracts.\n\n### Summary\nThis document effectively instructs users on how to secure their NEAR accounts by locking them, providing both quick and detailed methods for removing access keys. It reassures users about the security implications of locking accounts and highlights the ability of contracts to self-upgrade, which is crucial for maintaining functionality even in a locked state."}]}

It contains several assertions to validate the behavior of the `Vector` implementation, particularly focusing on its `pop` method, serialization, and iteration functionality. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Overview\n\n1. **Assertions on `pop` Method**: \n   - The code begins by asserting that the result of `pop` from the `baseline` (a standard Rust vector) is equal to the result of `pop` from the `vec` (the NEAR `Vector` implementation). This ensures that both data structures behave similarly when elements are removed from the end.\n\n2. **Debug Format Assertions**:\n   - Depending on whether the `expensive-debug` feature is enabled, the code compares the debug output of the `vec` with the `baseline`. This is useful for verifying that the internal state of the `Vector` matches expectations. The use of `format!(\"{:#?}\", ...)` provides a pretty-printed version of the struct for easier human reading, while `format!(\"{:?}\", ...)` provides a more compact representation.\n\n3. **Struct Definition**:\n   ```rust\n   #[derive(Debug, BorshDeserialize)]\n   #[allow(dead_code)]\n   struct WithoutBorshSerialize(u64);\n   ```\n   - A helper struct `WithoutBorshSerialize` is defined, which implements `Debug` and `BorshDeserialize`. This struct is likely used for testing purposes, specifically to ensure that the `Vector` can handle deserialization of elements that do not require serialization.\n\n4. **Deserialization Vector**:\n   - A new `Vector` instance `deserialize_only_vec` is created with the same length as `vec` and a prefix. The `baseline` vector is transformed into a vector of `WithoutBorshSerialize` instances. This step is important for testing that the `Vector` can correctly manage elements that are deserialized but don’t need to be serialized.\n\n5. **Further Format Assertions**:\n   - Similar to earlier, assertions check the formatted output of `deserialize_only_vec` against `baseline` again, under both the debug and non-debug configurations.\n\n6. **Iterator Checks**:\n   - The `iterator_checks` function tests the iterator functionality of the `Vector`. It initializes a `Vector` and a baseline vector, pushing integers 0 to 9 into both. \n   - The iterator of `vec` is compared with that of `baseline` using various iterator methods (`next`, `next_back`, `nth`, and `nth_back`). This ensures that the `Vector` supports the same iteration patterns as a standard vector.\n\n7. **Indexing Overflow Checks**:\n   - The code checks that calling `nth(5)` after consuming the first five elements returns `None`, verifying that the iterator handles out-of-bounds indices as expected.\n\n8. **Count Check**:\n   - Finally, it asserts that the number of elements in `vec` matches the length of `baseline` using the `count()` method, ensuring that both data structures contain the same number of elements.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis code is a series of tests designed to ensure that the `Vector` implementation in the NEAR SDK behaves correctly in terms of element removal, formatting, deserialization, and iteration. The tests are comprehensive, covering various scenarios to confirm that the `Vector` functions similarly to Rust's built-in vector, while also verifying that it adheres to NEAR's serialization and deserialization requirements.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n- **Vectors**: Dynamic arrays that can grow and shrink in size.\n- **Serialization and Deserialization**: The process of converting data structures to a format that can be stored or transmitted and then reconstructing them.\n- **Iterators**: A design pattern that allows for traversing elements in a collection without exposing the underlying structure.\n\nThis snippet is a good example of unit testing in Rust, where the emphasis is on ensuring that custom data structures behave as expected."}]}

This code snippet is part of the test utility functions for working with the NEAR Protocol using the `near-api-js` library. Below is a detailed explanation of the main components of the code:\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n1. **Imports and Configurations**:\n   ```javascript\n   const fs = require('fs').promises;\n   const nearApi = require('../src/index');\n   const networkId = 'unittest';\n   ```\n   - The code imports the `fs` module with promises support for asynchronous file operations and the `near-api-js` library to interact with the NEAR blockchain.\n   - It sets a constant `networkId` to `'unittest'`, indicating that the tests will run against a testing network.\n\n2. **Constants for WASM Paths and Methods**:\n   ```javascript\n   const HELLO_WASM_PATH = process.env.HELLO_WASM_PATH || 'node_modules/near-hello/dist/main.wasm';\n   const HELLO_WASM_BALANCE = BigInt('10000000000000000000000000');\n   const HELLO_WASM_METHODS = {\n       viewMethods: ['getValue', 'getLastResult'],\n       changeMethods: ['setValue', 'callPromise']\n   };\n   const MULTISIG_WASM_PATH = process.env.MULTISIG_WASM_PATH || './test/wasm/multisig.wasm';\n   const RANDOM_ACCOUNT_LENGTH = 40;\n   ```\n   - `HELLO_WASM_PATH` specifies the path to the WASM file for a sample smart contract, defaulting to a location in `node_modules`.\n   - `HELLO_WASM_BALANCE` sets the initial balance for the deployed contract in NEAR tokens (using BigInt for precision).\n   - `HELLO_WASM_METHODS` defines the methods exposed by the contract: which are view methods (`getValue`, `getLastResult`) and change methods (`setValue`, `callPromise`).\n   - `MULTISIG_WASM_PATH` defines the path for a multi-signature contract.\n   - `RANDOM_ACCOUNT_LENGTH` specifies the minimum length for randomly generated account names.\n\n3. **Setting Up a Test Connection**:\n   ```javascript\n   async function setUpTestConnection() {\n       const keyStore = new nearApi.keyStores.InMemoryKeyStore();\n       const config = Object.assign(await require('./config')(process.env.NODE_ENV || 'test'), {\n           networkId,\n           keyStore\n       });\n\n       if (config.masterAccount) {\n           const secretKey = config.secretKey || 'ed25519:2wyRc...';\n           await keyStore.setKey(networkId, config.masterAccount, KeyPair.fromString(secretKey));\n       }\n       return nearApi.connect(config);\n   }\n   ```\n   - This asynchronous function sets up a connection to the NEAR blockchain.\n   - It initializes an in-memory key store and merges it with the configuration from a separate config file.\n   - If a `masterAccount` is defined, it retrieves the secret key (defaulting to a hardcoded value) and stores it in the key store.\n   - Finally, it returns a connection to the NEAR network.\n\n4. **Generating Unique Account Names**:\n   ```javascript\n   function generateUniqueString(prefix) {\n       let result = `${prefix}-${Date.now()}-${Math.round(Math.random() * 1000000)}`;\n       let add_symbols = Math.max(RANDOM_ACCOUNT_LENGTH - result.length, 1);\n       for (let i = add_symbols; i > 0; --i) result += '0';\n       return result;\n   }\n   ```\n   - This function generates a unique string for account names by combining a prefix, the current timestamp, and a random number.\n   - It ensures the generated string meets the `RANDOM_ACCOUNT_LENGTH`.\n\n5. **Creating an Account**:\n   ```javascript\n   async function createAccount(near) {\n       const newAccountName = generateUniqueString('test');\n       const newPublicKey = await near.connection.signer.createKey(newAccountName, networkId);\n       await near.createAccount(newAccountName, newPublicKey);\n       const account = new nearApi.Account(near.connection, newAccountName);\n       return account;\n   }\n   ```\n   - This function creates a new NEAR account with a unique name and public key.\n   - It uses the provided `near` connection to generate the key and create an account, returning an instance of `nearApi.Account`.\n\n6. **Creating a Multisig Account**:\n   ```javascript\n   async function createAccountMultisig(near, options) {\n       // Similar to createAccount, but also handles multisig key setup and contract deployment.\n   }\n   ```\n   - This function extends the account creation to support multi-signature accounts, which require additional setup for confirming transactions.\n\n7. **Deploying a Contract**:\n   ```javascript\n   async function deployContract(workingAccount, contractId) {\n       // Deploys a contract to the blockchain from a specified account.\n   }\n   ```\n   - This function reads the WASM file, creates a public key for the contract, and deploys it to the NEAR network.\n\n8. **Utility Functions**:\n   ```javascript\n   function sleep(time) {\n       return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, time));\n   }\n\n   function waitFor(fn) {\n       const _waitFor = async (count = 10) => {\n           // Retries the provided function until it succeeds or the count runs out.\n       };\n   }\n   ```\n   - `sleep` creates a delay, while `waitFor` allows for retrying a function call, which can be useful in tests where asynchronous operations may take time.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis code snippet provides utility functions and configurations necessary for setting up tests on NEAR Protocol.

Below is a detailed breakdown of the code, explaining its key components and their functionality.\n\n### Imports and Setup\n\n```javascript\nimport childProcess from \"child_process\";\nimport { promisify } from \"util\";\nimport signal from \"signale\";\nimport { Project } from \"ts-morph\";\nimport chalk from \"chalk\";\n\nconst { Signale } = signal;\nconst exec = promisify(childProcess.exec);\n```\n\n- **`child_process`**: This Node.js module allows for spawning child processes, including executing shell commands.\n- **`util.promisify`**: Converts a callback-based function into a promise-based function, allowing for easier async/await syntax.\n- **`signale`**: A logging library that provides a way to log messages with different styles (info, error, etc.).\n- **`ts-morph`**: A library for TypeScript that provides an API for working with TypeScript projects, such as parsing and analyzing TypeScript code.\n- **`chalk`**: A library for styling terminal output with colors.\n\n### `executeCommand` Function\n\n```javascript\nexport async function executeCommand(\n  command: string,\n  verbose = false\n): Promise<string> {\n  const signale = new Signale({ scope: \"exec\", interactive: !verbose });\n\n  if (verbose) {\n    signale.info(`Running command: ${command}`);\n  }\n\n  let stdout, stderr, code = 0;\n  try {\n    ({ stdout, stderr } = await exec(command));\n  } catch (error) {\n    ({ stdout, stderr, code } = error);\n  }\n  if (code != 0) {\n    signale.error(`Command failed: ${command}`);\n    \n    const failDueToNameConflict = stderr.match(/conflicting types for '([a-zA-Z0-9_]+)'/);\n    if (failDueToNameConflict && failDueToNameConflict.length > 1) {\n      signale.error(`'${failDueToNameConflict[1]}' is a reserved word, please use another name for contract method\"`);\n    }\n  }\n  if (stderr && verbose) {\n    signale.error(`Command stderr: ${stderr}`);\n  }\n  if (verbose) {\n    signale.info(`Command stdout: ${stdout}`);\n  }\n  if (code != 0) {\n    process.exit(1);\n  }\n  return stdout.trim();\n}\n```\n\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `command`: The shell command to execute.\n  - `verbose`: A boolean to indicate whether to log detailed output.\n\n- **Functionality**:\n  - Creates a `Signale` instance for logging.\n  - If `verbose` is true, it logs the command being executed.\n  - The command is executed using `exec`, and the results are destructured into `stdout`, `stderr`, and `code`.\n  - If the command fails (`code != 0`), it logs the error and checks for specific error patterns (like name conflicts).\n  - If `stderr` is present and `verbose` is true, it logs the error output.\n  - If the command fails, the process exits with code `1`.\n  - Returns the trimmed standard output (`stdout`).\n\n### `download` Function\n\n```javascript\nexport async function download(url: string, verbose = false) {\n  await executeCommand(`curl -LOf ${url}`, verbose);\n}\n```\n\n- **Functionality**:\n  - Utilizes the `executeCommand` function to perform a `curl` command to download a file from the specified `url`.\n  - The `verbose` flag is passed to log detailed output if desired.\n\n### `validateContract` Function\n\n```javascript\nexport async function validateContract(\n  contractPath: string,\n  verbose = false\n): Promise<boolean> {\n  const signale = new Signale({ scope: \"validate-contract\" });\n  \n  const project = new Project();\n  project.addSourceFilesAtPaths(contractPath);\n\n  const sourceFile = project.getSourceFile(contractPath);\n  const classDeclarations = sourceFile.getClasses();\n\n  for (const classDeclaration of classDeclarations) {\n    const classStructure = classDeclaration.getStructure();\n    const { decorators, properties, name } = classStructure;\n    const hasNearBindgen = decorators.some(\n      ({ name }) => name === \"NearBindgen\"\n    );\n\n    if (hasNearBindgen) {\n      if (verbose) {\n        signale.info(`Validating ${name} class...`);\n      }\n\n      const constructors = classDeclaration.getConstructors();\n      const hasConstructor = constructors.length > 0;\n      const propertiesToBeInited = properties.filter(\n        ({ initializer }) => !initializer\n      );\n\n      if (!hasConstructor && propertiesToBeInited.length === 0) {\n        return true;\n      }\n\n      if (!hasConstructor && propertiesToBeInited.length > 0) {\n        signale.error(\n          chalk.redBright(\n            `${UNINITIALIZED_PARAMETERS_ERROR} ${propertiesToBeInited\n              .map(({ name }) => name)\n              .join(\", \")}`\n          )\n        );\n        return false;\n      }\n\n      const [constructor] = constructors;\n      const constructorContent = constructor.getText();\n\n      if (verbose) {\n        signale.info(\"Checking for non initialized properties...\");\n      }\n\n      const nonInitedProperties = propertiesToBeInited.reduce(\n        (properties, { name }) => {\n          if (constructorContent.includes(`this.${name}`)) {\n            return properties;\n          }\n\n          return [...properties, name];\n        },\n        [] as string[]\n      );\n\n      if (nonInitedProperties.length > 0) {\n        signale.error(\n          chalk.redBright(\n            `${UNINITIALIZED_PARAMETERS_ERROR} ${nonInitedProperties.join(\n              \", \"\n            )}`\n          )\n        );\n        return false;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  return true;\n}\n```\n\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `contractPath`: The file path to the TypeScript contract.\n  - `verbose`: Boolean indicating whether to log detailed output.\n\n- **Functionality**:\n  - Creates a `Signale` instance for logging validation processes.\n  - Uses `ts-morph` to parse the contract file and retrieve class declarations.\n  - Checks for classes decorated with `@NearBindgen`, which means they are NEAR smart contracts.\n  - Validates that all properties defined in the class are initialized in the constructor.\n  - If any properties are found to be uninitialized, it logs an error message and returns `false`.\n  - If all properties are correctly initialized, it returns `true`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis code snippet provides utility functions for executing shell commands and validating NEAR smart contracts written in TypeScript. The `executeCommand` function handles command execution and logging, while the `validateContract` function ensures that contract properties are properly initialized, which is crucial for maintaining contract integrity on the NEAR blockchain. The use of asynchronous programming, error handling, and logging improves the usability and robustness of these utilities."}]}

It defines a class called `NearEvent`, which facilitates the creation and emission of events that can be logged on the NEAR blockchain. Let's break down the code step by step:\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n```javascript\nimport { near } from \"near-sdk-js\";\n```\n- This line imports the `near` object from the `near-sdk-js` package, which provides various utilities and functions for interacting with the NEAR blockchain, including logging capabilities.\n\n```javascript\nexport class NearEvent {\n```\n- This line defines a new class called `NearEvent`. By using the `export` keyword, the class can be imported and used in other modules or files.\n\n```javascript\n    internal_to_json_string() {\n        return JSON.stringify(this);\n    }\n```\n- This method, `internal_to_json_string`, converts the current instance of the `NearEvent` class into a JSON string representation. It uses `JSON.stringify(this)` to serialize the object, which means it will include all properties of the instance in the resulting string.\n\n```javascript\n    internal_to_json_event_string() {\n        return `EVENT_JSON: ${this.internal_to_json_string()}`;\n    }\n```\n- This method, `internal_to_json_event_string`, is responsible for formatting the JSON string returned by `internal_to_json_string`. It prefixes the JSON string with `EVENT_JSON: ` to indicate that this string represents an event. This format can help distinguish event logs from other log messages when they are read from the blockchain.\n\n```javascript\n    /**\n     * Logs the event to the host. This is required to ensure that the event is triggered\n     * and to consume the event.\n     */\n    emit() {\n        near.log(this.internal_to_json_event_string());\n    }\n```\n- The `emit` method is crucial for logging the event. It uses the `near.log()` function from the `near-sdk-js` library to log the formatted event string generated by `internal_to_json_event_string`. This logging is essential for ensuring that the event is recorded and can be consumed by other parts of the NEAR ecosystem, such as frontend applications or event listeners.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe `NearEvent` class serves as a utility for creating and emitting structured event logs within NEAR smart contracts. By providing methods to convert the instance to JSON and log it with a specific format, this class helps developers easily emit events that can be tracked and utilized effectively in the NEAR ecosystem.\n\n### Usage Example\n\nHere's a simple example of how you might use the `NearEvent` class within a smart contract:\n\n```javascript\nimport { NearEvent } from './event.js';\n\nclass MyContract {\n    constructor() {\n        // Initialize contract state\n    }\n\n    someFunction() {\n        // Create an event instance\n        const event = new NearEvent();\n        event.property1 = \"value1\";\n        event.property2 = \"value2\";\n        \n        // Emit the event\n        event.emit();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `MyContract` creates an instance of `NearEvent`, sets some properties, and then emits the event so that it gets logged on the NEAR blockchain."}]}

Below, I'll break down the code and explain its components in detail.\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n#### Module Declaration\n```rust\nmod sign_as;\n```\nThis line declares a submodule named `sign_as`. It likely contains additional functionality related to signing transactions, particularly for relayers.\n\n#### Struct Definition\n```rust\n#[derive(Debug, Clone, interactive_clap::InteractiveClap)]\n#[interactive_clap(input_context = crate::GlobalContext)]\n#[interactive_clap(output_context = SendMetaTransactionContext)]\npub struct SendMetaTransaction {\n    /// Enter a signed delegate action as base64-encoded string:\n    signed_delegate_action: crate::types::signed_delegate_action::SignedDelegateActionAsBase64,\n    #[interactive_clap(named_arg)]\n    /// What is the relayer account ID?\n    sign_as: self::sign_as::RelayerAccountId,\n}\n```\n\n1. **Attributes**:\n   - `#[derive(Debug, Clone, interactive_clap::InteractiveClap)]`: This macro derives implementations for the `Debug` and `Clone` traits, allowing the struct to be printed in a debug format and cloned. The `interactive_clap::InteractiveClap` trait enables interactive command-line input for this struct, making it suitable for use in CLI applications.\n   - `#[interactive_clap(input_context = crate::GlobalContext)]`: This specifies that the input context for the interactive clap is `GlobalContext`, which likely holds global configuration or state information needed throughout the application.\n   - `#[interactive_clap(output_context = SendMetaTransactionContext)]`: This specifies that the output context, after processing the command, will be an instance of `SendMetaTransactionContext`.\n\n2. **Fields**:\n   - `signed_delegate_action`: This field expects a base64-encoded string representing a signed delegate action. It uses a type defined in `crate::types::signed_delegate_action::SignedDelegateActionAsBase64`, which ensures type safety and clarity.\n   - `sign_as`: This field is annotated with `#[interactive_clap(named_arg)]`, indicating that it's a named argument in the interactive command. It holds the relayer account ID, which is defined in the `sign_as` module.\n\n#### Context Struct Definition\n```rust\n#[derive(Debug, Clone)]\npub struct SendMetaTransactionContext {\n    global_context: crate::GlobalContext,\n    signed_delegate_action: near_primitives::action::delegate::SignedDelegateAction,\n}\n```\nThis struct holds the context for the `SendMetaTransaction` command. \n\n1. **Fields**:\n   - `global_context`: Contains the global state or configuration, leveraging the `GlobalContext` type.\n   - `signed_delegate_action`: This holds the actual signed delegate action of type `near_primitives::action::delegate::SignedDelegateAction`, which is likely a structured representation of the action to be performed.\n\n#### Implementation Block\n```rust\nimpl SendMetaTransactionContext {\n    pub fn from_previous_context(\n        previous_context: crate::GlobalContext,\n        scope: &<SendMetaTransaction as interactive_clap::ToInteractiveClapContextScope>::InteractiveClapContextScope,\n    ) -> color_eyre::eyre::Result<Self> {\n        Ok(Self {\n            global_context: previous_context,\n            signed_delegate_action: scope.signed_delegate_action.inner.clone(),\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n1. **Method**: `from_previous_context`\n   - This method constructs a new `SendMetaTransactionContext` from a previous context (`previous_context`) and a scope that provides access to the command's parameters.\n   \n2. **Parameters**:\n   - `previous_context`: The global context that is passed from the previous command or state.\n   - `scope`: A reference to the interactive context scope, allowing access to the signed delegate action.\n\n3. **Return Type**: The method returns a `Result<Self, color_eyre::eyre::Result>`, which indicates that it may produce an error wrapped in the `color_eyre` error handling library.\n\n4. **Functionality**: \n   - It initializes the new context by copying the `global_context` and cloning the inner signed delegate action from the `scope`.\n\n### Summary\nThis code snippet is part of a command structure for sending meta transactions in the NEAR Protocol. It defines a command with required input fields, the contexts used for the command, and a method to create a new context based on previous states.

This code serves as a foundation for managing and validating NFT metadata in a structured manner. Let's break down the key components:\n\n### Imports and Constants\n\n```javascript\nimport { assert } from \"near-sdk-js\";\n/** This spec can be treated like a version of the standard. */\nexport const NFT_METADATA_SPEC = \"nft-1.0.0\";\n```\n\n- **Import Statement**: The `assert` function is imported from the `near-sdk-js`, which is used for validating conditions throughout the code.\n- **NFT_METADATA_SPEC**: This constant holds the version of the NFT metadata specification, allowing the code to validate that the metadata conforms to this version.\n\n### NFTContractMetadata Class\n\n```javascript\nexport class NFTContractMetadata {\n    constructor() {\n        this.spec = NFT_METADATA_SPEC;\n        this.name = \"\";\n        this.symbol = \"\";\n        this.icon = null;\n        this.base_uri = null;\n        this.reference = null;\n        this.reference_hash = null;\n    }\n```\n\n- **Constructor**: Initializes an NFT contract metadata object with default values. The `spec` is set to the constant defined earlier.\n\n```javascript\n    init(spec, name, symbol, icon, base_uri, reference, reference_hash) {\n        this.spec = spec;\n        this.name = name;\n        this.symbol = symbol;\n        this.icon = icon;\n        this.base_uri = base_uri;\n        this.reference = reference;\n        this.reference_hash = reference_hash;\n    }\n```\n\n- **init Method**: This method allows for the initialization of the metadata properties with provided values. It is useful for setting the actual values post-construction.\n\n```javascript\n    assert_valid() {\n        assert(this.spec == NFT_METADATA_SPEC, \"Spec is not NFT metadata\");\n        assert((this.reference != null) == (this.reference_hash != null), \"Reference and reference hash must be present\");\n        if (this.reference_hash != null) {\n            assert(this.reference_hash.length == 32, \"Hash has to be 32 bytes\");\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n- **assert_valid Method**: Validates the properties of the NFT contract metadata:\n  - Ensures the metadata specification matches the expected version.\n  - Checks that if a `reference` is provided, a `reference_hash` must also be present, and vice versa.\n  - If a `reference_hash` is provided, it must be exactly 32 bytes long.\n\n```javascript\n    static reconstruct(data) {\n        const metadata = new NFTContractMetadata();\n        Object.assign(metadata, data);\n        return metadata;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n- **reconstruct Method**: A static method that creates a new instance of `NFTContractMetadata` and populates it with values from a provided data object. This is useful for deserializing metadata from storage or network.\n\n### TokenMetadata Class\n\n```javascript\nexport class TokenMetadata {\n    constructor(title, description, media, media_hash, copies, issued_at, expires_at, starts_at, updated_at, extra, reference, reference_hash) {\n        this.title = title; // ex. \"Arch Nemesis: Mail Carrier\" or \"Parcel #5055\"\n        this.description = description; // free-form description\n        this.media = media; // URL to associated media\n        this.media_hash = media_hash; // Required if media is included\n        this.copies = copies; // number of copies of this metadata\n        this.issued_at = issued_at; // when token was minted\n        this.expires_at = expires_at; // when token expires\n        this.starts_at = starts_at; // when token starts being valid\n        this.updated_at = updated_at; // when token was last updated\n        this.extra = extra; // anything extra the NFT wants to store\n        this.reference = reference; // URL to an off-chain JSON file\n        this.reference_hash = reference_hash; // Required if reference is included\n    }\n```\n\n- **Constructor**: Initializes properties for an individual token's metadata, including title, description, media, timestamps, and references.\n\n```javascript\n    assert_valid() {\n        assert((this.media != null) == (this.media_hash != null), \"Media and media hash must be present\");\n        if (this.media_hash != null) {\n            assert(this.media_hash.length == 32, \"Media hash has to be 32 bytes\");\n        }\n        assert((this.reference != null) == (this.reference_hash != null), \"Reference and reference hash must be present\");\n        if (this.reference_hash != null) {\n            assert(this.reference_hash.length == 32, \"Reference hash has to be 32 bytes\");\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n- **assert_valid Method**: Similar to the `assert_valid` method in `NFTContractMetadata`, it validates the token metadata:\n  - Ensures that if `media` is provided, `media_hash` must also be included, and vice versa.\n  - Validates the length of the `media_hash` and `reference_hash` to be 32 bytes if they are present.\n\n```javascript\n    static reconstruct(data) {\n        return new TokenMetadata(data.title, data.description, data.media, data.media_hash, data.copies, data.issued_at, data.expires_at, data.starts_at, data.updated_at, data.extra, data.reference, data.reference_hash);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n- **reconstruct Method**: A static method that creates a new instance of `TokenMetadata` from a data object, allowing for easy deserialization.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis code snippet defines two classes, `NFTContractMetadata` and `TokenMetadata`, that encapsulate the metadata for NFTs and provide methods for initialization, validation, and reconstruction from serialized data. These classes adhere to a structured approach, ensuring that metadata is validated against specified rules, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of NFT data on the NEAR blockchain."}]}

The struct acts as a wrapper around the `url::Url` type from the `url` crate, providing additional functionality and easier integration with other parts of the codebase. Let's break down the various components of this code.\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n1. **Struct Definition**:\n   ```rust\n   #[derive(Debug, Clone)]\n   pub struct Url(pub url::Url);\n   ```\n   - `#[derive(Debug, Clone)]`: This macro automatically implements the `Debug` and `Clone` traits for the `Url` struct, allowing it to be printed using the `{:?}` format specifier and to be cloned.\n   - `pub struct Url(pub url::Url);`: This defines a public struct named `Url` that contains a single field of type `url::Url`. The `pub` keyword makes this struct accessible from other modules.\n\n2. **Conversion Implementations**:\n   ```rust\n   impl From<Url> for url::Url {\n       fn from(url: Url) -> Self {\n           url.0\n       }\n   }\n\n   impl From<url::Url> for Url {\n       fn from(url: url::Url) -> Self {\n           Self(url)\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n   - These implementations define two conversions between the `Url` struct and the `url::Url` type:\n     - The first implementation allows you to convert a `Url` to `url::Url` using the `From` trait. It simply returns the inner `url::Url` from the `Url` struct.\n     - The second implementation allows you to create a `Url` from a `url::Url`. It wraps the `url::Url` in the `Url` struct.\n\n3. **Display Implementation**:\n   ```rust\n   impl std::fmt::Display for Url {\n       fn fmt(&self, f: &mut std::fmt::Formatter<'_>) -> std::fmt::Result {\n           self.0.fmt(f)\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n   - This implementation allows instances of `Url` to be formatted as strings for display. The `fmt` method calls the `fmt` method of the inner `url::Url`, allowing `Url` to take advantage of the formatting capabilities of `url::Url`.\n\n4. **String Parsing Implementation**:\n   ```rust\n   impl std::str::FromStr for Url {\n       type Err = url::ParseError;\n\n       fn from_str(s: &str) -> Result<Self, Self::Err> {\n           let url = url::Url::parse(s)?;\n           Ok(Self(url))\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n   - This implementation allows creating a `Url` instance from a string. It uses the `FromStr` trait, which requires defining an associated error type (`url::ParseError`).\n   - The `from_str` method attempts to parse the input string into a `url::Url`. If successful, it wraps the result in the `Url` struct; otherwise, it returns the parsing error.\n\n5. **CLI Integration**:\n   ```rust\n   impl interactive_clap::ToCli for Url {\n       type CliVariant = Url;\n   }\n   ```\n   - This implementation likely integrates the `Url` struct with a command-line interface (CLI) framework, possibly allowing it to be used directly as a CLI argument or option.\n   - The `CliVariant` type indicates that the CLI representation of `Url` is itself, allowing for straightforward conversion in CLI contexts.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe `Url` struct serves as a convenient wrapper around the `url::Url` type, simplifying the usage and integration of URLs within the NEAR Protocol codebase. By implementing conversion traits, formatting, string parsing methods, and CLI integration, it enhances usability while ensuring type safety and clarity. This design pattern is common in Rust to provide more context or functionality around existing types."}]}

This code snippet from the NEAR repository's documentation addresses a common issue developers encounter when using the NEAR API for JavaScript (`near-api-js`). The error message indicates that the developer may be trying to use a KeyStore that is intended for browser environments in a Node.js context. Here's a detailed breakdown of the snippet:\n\n### Explanation of the Code Snippet\n\n1. **Context of the Error**:\n   - The error message suggests that the developer is likely using a `BrowserLocalStorageKeyStore`, which is designed for use in a web browser's local storage. This KeyStore is not suitable for a Node.js environment, where you typically want to use a different mechanism to manage keys.\n\n2. **KeyStore Types**:\n   - NEAR provides different types of KeyStores to manage cryptographic keys. The two types shown are:\n     - **Browser KeyStore**: This stores keys in the browser's local storage, making it suitable for web applications but not for server-side applications or scripts run in Node.js.\n     - **FileSystem KeyStore**: This stores keys in the file system, making it more appropriate for backend applications or scripts running in Node.js.\n\n3. **Example Code for Browser KeyStore**:\n   ```javascript\n   const { keyStores } = require(\"near-api-js\");\n   const keyStore = new keyStores.BrowserLocalStorageKeyStore();\n   ```\n   - **Imports**: The code imports `keyStores` from the `near-api-js` library.\n   - **Initialization**: It initializes a new `BrowserLocalStorageKeyStore`, which will store keys in the browser's local storage.\n\n4. **Example Code for FileSystem KeyStore**:\n   ```javascript\n   const { keyStores } = require(\"near-api-js\");\n   const KEY_PATH = \"~./near-credentials/testnet/example-account.json\";\n   const keyStore = new keyStores.UnencryptedFileSystemKeyStore(KEY_PATH);\n   ```\n   - **Imports**: Again, it imports `keyStores` from `near-api-js`.\n   - **Key Path Definition**: A variable `KEY_PATH` is assigned the path to a JSON file that contains the private key for the NEAR account. The path indicates where the key file is stored on the filesystem. Note that the `~.` may need to be corrected to `~` or a full path depending on your environment.\n   - **Initialization**: It initializes a new `UnencryptedFileSystemKeyStore`, which reads and writes keys to the specified file in the filesystem.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis snippet provides guidance on how to correctly set up a KeyStore for different environments while using the NEAR API. If you are working within a Node.js environment, you should opt for the `UnencryptedFileSystemKeyStore` to manage your keys securely and efficiently. For browser-based applications, use `BrowserLocalStorageKeyStore`.\n\n### Note on Security\nWhile using the `UnencryptedFileSystemKeyStore`, be aware that storing private keys in an unencrypted format can expose them to potential security risks. Ensure that appropriate security measures are taken when handling sensitive data in production environments."}]}

Below, I will explain the main components and functionality of the code:\n\n### Imports\n```javascript\nimport { Account, Connection, Contract } from '@near-js/accounts';\nimport { KeyPair } from '@near-js/crypto';\nimport { InMemoryKeyStore } from '@near-js/keystores';\nimport { test, expect, Page } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { getFastAuthIframe } from '../../utils/constants';\nimport {\n  createAccount, initializeAdmin,\n} from '../../utils/firebase';\nimport { overridePasskeyFunctions } from '../../utils/passkeys';\nimport { isWalletSelectorLoaded } from '../../utils/walletSelector';\nimport { TestDapp } from '../models/TestDapp';\n```\n- **NEAR SDK**: Imports modules from the NEAR SDK for JavaScript, such as `Account`, `Connection`, `Contract`, and `KeyPair` to manage accounts and cryptographic operations.\n- **Playwright**: Imports testing utilities from Playwright, a library for browser automation.\n- **Utility Functions**: Imports custom utility functions for interacting with Firebase, managing passkeys, and checking the wallet selector's readiness.\n\n### Test Setup\n```javascript\nconst { describe, beforeAll } = test;\n\nlet page: Page;\nconst userFAK = KeyPair.fromRandom('ed25519');\nconst userLAK = KeyPair.fromRandom('ed25519');\nlet accountId;\n\ndescribe('Sign transaction', () => {\n  beforeAll(async ({ browser }, { workerIndex }) => {\n    initializeAdmin();\n```\n- **Test Suite**: The `describe` function initializes a test suite called \"Sign transaction\".\n- **Key Pair Generation**: Two random key pairs (`userFAK` and `userLAK`) are generated for the user.\n- **Global Variables**: `page` and `accountId` are declared at the top for use across tests.\n\n### Account Initialization\n```javascript\nconst context = await browser.newContext();\npage = await context.newPage();\nconst testDapp = new TestDapp(page);\nconst user = `testuser-playwright-fastauth-${workerIndex}-${Date.now()}`;\nconst email = `${user}@example.com`;\naccountId = `${user}.testnet`;\nconst frpKeypair = KeyPair.fromRandom('ed25519');\nawait createAccount({\n  email,\n  accountId: user,\n  FAKs:      [userFAK],\n  LAKs:      [{\n    public_key:   userLAK.getPublicKey().toString(),\n    receiver_id:  accountId,\n    allowance:    '100000000000000000000000000',\n    method_names: '[\"claim\"]',\n  }],\n  oidcKeyPair: frpKeypair\n});\n```\n- **Browser Context**: A new browser context and page are created for the tests, isolating test data.\n- **Test User Creation**: Constructs a unique user ID and email. Calls `createAccount` to create a new account in the test environment, assigning the generated key pairs and other required parameters.\n\n### Setting Up Transaction Data\n```javascript\nawait page.goto('/');\nawait page.waitForLoadState('domcontentloaded');\nawait testDapp.loginWithKeyPairLocalStorage(accountId, userLAK, userFAK);\nawait page.evaluate(([accountId]) => {\n  window.localStorage.setItem('transactionData', JSON.stringify({\n    receiverId: 'v1.social08.testnet',\n    actions:    [\n      {\n        type:   'FunctionCall',\n        params: {\n          methodName: 'set',\n          args:       {\n            data: {\n              [accountId]: {\n                'fast-auth-e2e-test': 'true'\n              }\n            }\n          },\n          gas:     '300000000000000',\n          deposit: '20000000000000000000000'\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }));\n}, [accountId]);\n```\n- **Navigation**: Navigates to the root of the application and waits until the DOM content is fully loaded.\n- **Login**: Logs the user into the application using the provided key pairs.\n- **Transaction Data Storage**: Sets up transaction data in the local storage, including the receiver ID and the actions to be executed. This data will be used in subsequent tests to simulate a transaction signing scenario.\n\n### Test Cases\n#### 1. Displaying Transaction Details\n```javascript\ntest('should display signerId, transaction amount, receiverId and args', async () => {\n  await page.goto('/');\n  await isWalletSelectorLoaded(page);\n  await page.getByTestId('sign-transaction-button').click();\n\n  await expect(getFastAuthIframe(page).getByText(accountId)).toBeVisible();\n  await getFastAuthIframe(page).getByTestId('more-details-button').click();\n  await getFastAuthIframe(page).getByTestId('function-call-button').click();\n\n  await expect(getFastAuthIframe(page).getByText(/v1.social08.testnet/)).toHaveCount(2);\n  await expect(getFastAuthIframe(page).getByText(/\"fast-auth-e2e-test\": \"true\"/)).toBeVisible();\n});\n```\n- **Expectations**: This test verifies that the signer ID, transaction amount, receiver ID, and transaction arguments are displayed correctly in the Fast Auth iframe after the user initiates a transaction.\n\n#### 2. Authentication Failure Case\n```javascript\ntest('should fail if signer app is not authenticated', async () => {\n  await page.goto('/');\n  await isWalletSelectorLoaded(page);\n  await overridePasskeyFunctions(page, {\n    creationKeypair:  KeyPair.fromRandom('ed25519'),\n    retrievalKeypair: KeyPair.fromRandom('ed25519')\n  });\n\n  await page.getByTestId('sign-transaction-button').click();\n  await getFastAuthIframe(page).locator('data-test-id=confirm-transaction-button').click();\n\n  await expect(getFastAuthIframe(page).getByText('You are not authenticated or there has been an indexer failure')).toBeVisible();\n});\n```\n- **Authentication Check**: Tests that when the signer app is not authenticated (using random key pairs), an appropriate error message is displayed.\n\n#### 3. Successful Authentication Case\n```javascript\ntest('should succeed and dismiss when signer app is authenticated', async () => {\n  await page.goto('/');\n  await isWalletSelectorLoaded(page);\n  await overridePasskeyFunctions(page, {\n    creationKeypair:  userFAK,\n    retrievalKeypair: userFAK\n  });\n\n  await page.getByTestId('sign-transaction-button').click();\n  await getFastAuthIframe(page).locator('data-test-id=confirm-transaction-button').click();\n  const socialdbContract = new Contract(new Account(Connection...\n```\n- **Successful Transaction Signing**: This test checks that when the signer app is authenticated with the correct key pair, the transaction can be successfully signed and the corresponding UI updates as intended.\n\n### Summary\nThis code is a comprehensive setup for testing transaction signing in a NEAR dApp using Playwright. It creates a test user, initializes local storage with transaction data, and verifies various scenarios related to transaction signing, including displaying transaction details and handling authentication states. Each test case is structured to ensure clarity and accuracy in confirming the expected behavior of the Fast Auth mechanism within the application."}]}

Below is a detailed breakdown of the key components of the code:\n\n### 1. Liquid Storage Stake Calculation\n```rust\nfn liquid_storage_stake(&self) -> near_token::NearToken {\n    self.storage_stake\n        .saturating_sub(self.account_locked_balance)\n}\n```\n- **Purpose**: This function computes the liquid storage stake of an account, which represents the portion of the storage stake that is not locked and can be transferred or used.\n- **Logic**: It takes the total `storage_stake` and subtracts the `account_locked_balance`. The use of `saturating_sub` ensures that if the result is negative, it will return zero instead, preventing underflow.\n\n### 2. Transfer Allowance Calculation\n```rust\npub fn transfer_allowance(&self) -> near_token::NearToken {\n    self.account_liquid_balance\n        .saturating_sub(self.liquid_storage_stake())\n        .saturating_sub(self.pessimistic_transaction_fee)\n}\n```\n- **Purpose**: This function calculates the transfer allowance for an account. It determines how much of the account's liquid balance can be transferred, factoring in the liquid storage stake and a pessimistic transaction fee.\n- **Logic**: It starts with the `account_liquid_balance`, then deducts the liquid storage stake (calculated from the previous function) and a predefined pessimistic transaction fee.\n\n### 3. Getting Account Transfer Allowance\n```rust\n#[tracing::instrument(name = \"Getting the transfer allowance for the account ...\", skip_all)]\npub async fn get_account_transfer_allowance(\n    network_config: &crate::config::NetworkConfig,\n    account_id: near_primitives::types::AccountId,\n    block_reference: BlockReference,\n) -> color_eyre::eyre::Result<AccountTransferAllowance> {\n    let account_state = get_account_state(network_config, &account_id, block_reference).await;\n```\n- **Purpose**: This asynchronous function retrieves the transfer allowance for a specific account.\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `network_config`: Configuration for the network.\n  - `account_id`: The NEAR account ID for which the allowance is being queried.\n  - `block_reference`: A reference to the block to get the account state from.\n\n### 4. Handling Account State Errors\n```rust\n    let account_view = match account_state {\n        Ok(account_view) => account_view,\n        Err(near_jsonrpc_client::errors::JsonRpcError::ServerError(\n            near_jsonrpc_client::errors::JsonRpcServerError::HandlerError(\n                near_jsonrpc_primitives::types::query::RpcQueryError::UnknownAccount { .. },\n            ),\n        )) if account_id.get_account_type().is_implicit() => {\n            return Ok(AccountTransferAllowance {\n                account_id,\n                account_liquid_balance: near_token::NearToken::from_near(0),\n                account_locked_balance: near_token::NearToken::from_near(0),\n                storage_stake: near_token::NearToken::from_near(0),\n                pessimistic_transaction_fee: near_token::NearToken::from_near(0),\n            });\n        }\n        // Handling other error cases...\n    };\n```\n- **Purpose**: This section processes the result of retrieving the account state. If the account is not found and is of \"implicit\" type, it returns default values for the transfer allowance.\n- **Error Handling**: It handles different types of errors, such as server errors and transport errors, providing clear feedback on issues encountered while retrieving account information.\n\n### 5. Storage Fee Calculation\n```rust\nlet storage_amount_per_byte = network_config\n    .json_rpc_client()\n    .call(\n        near_jsonrpc_client::methods::EXPERIMENTAL_protocol_config::RpcProtocolConfigRequest {\n            block_reference: near_primitives::types::Finality::Final.into(),\n        },\n    )\n    .await\n    .wrap_err(\"RpcError\")?\n    .runtime_config\n    .storage_amount_per_byte;\n```\n- **Purpose**: This block retrieves the current storage fee defined per byte from the NEAR protocol configuration.\n- **Logic**: It makes an RPC call to get the protocol configuration, and specifically extracts the `storage_amount_per_byte` value.\n\n### 6. Returning Account Transfer Allowance\n```rust\nOk(AccountTransferAllowance {\n    account_id,\n    account_liquid_balance: near_token::NearToken::from_yoctonear(account_view.amount),\n    account_locked_balance: near_token::NearToken::from_yoctonear(account_view.locked),\n    storage_stake: near_token::NearToken::from_yoctonear(\n        u128::from(account_view.storage_usage) * storage_amount_per_byte,\n    ),\n    pessimistic_transaction_fee: near_token::NearToken::from_millinear(1),\n})\n```\n- **Purpose**: This constructs and returns an instance of `AccountTransferAllowance` containing the calculated values for the account's liquid balance, locked balance, storage stake, and transaction fee.\n- **Conversion**: The balances are converted from raw values (like `amount` and `locked`) to `NearToken`, which is a custom type representing NEAR tokens.\n\n### Summary\nThe provided code snippet is part of the NEAR Protocol's account management functionality, specifically for computing the transfer allowance of an account. It carefully manages various types of account states and errors while ensuring safe calculations regarding balances and fees. Proper handling of possible errors and conversion of raw values into user-friendly representations of tokens are critical parts of this implementation."}]}

The functions shown are primarily concerned with set operations such as checking for subsets and supersets, iterating over elements, and managing the contents of the set. Let's break down each part and explain its functionality.\n\n### 1. `is_subset` Method\n\n```rust\npub fn is_subset(&self, other: &IterableSet<T, H>) -> bool\nwhere\n    T: BorshDeserialize + Clone,\n{\n    if self.len() <= other.len() {\n        self.iter().all(|v| other.contains(v))\n    } else {\n        false\n    }\n}\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: This method checks if the current set (`self`) is a subset of another set (`other`). A set A is a subset of set B if all elements of A are also in B.\n- **Logic**:\n  - First, it compares the lengths of both sets. If `self` has more elements than `other`, it cannot be a subset, and it returns `false`.\n  - If the length condition is satisfied, it uses the `iter()` method to iterate through all elements of `self` and checks if each element is contained in `other` using `contains()`.\n  \n### 2. `is_superset` Method\n\n```rust\npub fn is_superset(&self, other: &IterableSet<T, H>) -> bool\nwhere\n    T: BorshDeserialize + Clone,\n{\n    other.is_subset(self)\n}\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: This method checks if the current set (`self`) is a superset of another set (`other`). A set A is a superset of set B if A contains at least all elements of B.\n- **Logic**: It simply calls the `is_subset` method on `other`, passing `self` as the argument. This leverages the relationship between subsets and supersets.\n\n### 3. `iter` Method\n\n```rust\npub fn iter(&self) -> Iter<T>\nwhere\n    T: BorshDeserialize,\n{\n    Iter::new(self)\n}\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: This method returns an iterator over the elements of the set.\n- **Implementation**: It creates a new iterator instance (presumably defined in the `Iter<T>` type) initialized with the current `IterableSet`.\n\n### 4. `drain` Method\n\n```rust\npub fn drain(&mut self) -> Drain<T, H>\nwhere\n    T: BorshDeserialize,\n{\n    Drain::new(self)\n}\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: This method clears the set while returning an iterator over its elements. This is useful for processing all elements before disposing of them.\n- **Implementation**: It creates and returns an instance of `Drain`, which likely implements the `Iterator` trait for consuming elements from the set.\n\n### 5. `contains` Method\n\n```rust\npub fn contains<Q: ?Sized>(&self, value: &Q) -> bool\nwhere\n    T: Borrow<Q>,\n    Q: BorshSerialize + ToOwned<Owned = T> + Ord,\n{\n    self.index.contains_key(value)\n}\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: Checks if the set contains a specified value.\n- **Generics and Bounds**: \n  - It uses a generic parameter `Q`, allowing for borrowed forms of the set's value type.\n  - The constraints ensure that the borrowed type can be serialized and compared, which is necessary for checking membership.\n- **Logic**: It checks if the `index` (presumably a hash map or similar structure) contains the given value.\n\n### 6. `insert` Method\n\n```rust\npub fn insert(&mut self, value: T) -> bool\nwhere\n    T: Clone + BorshDeserialize,\n{\n    let entry = self.index.get_mut_inner(&value);\n    if entry.value_mut().is_some() {\n        false\n    } else {\n        self.elements.push(value);\n        let element_index = self.elements.len() - 1;\n        entry.replace(Some(element_index));\n        true\n    }\n}\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: Adds a value to the set if it doesn't already exist.\n- **Logic**:\n  - It checks if the value is present in the `index`. If it is, it returns `false`.\n  - If not, it pushes the value to the `elements` vector and updates the `index` to reflect the new value's position.\n  - Returns `true` to indicate the value was successfully added.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis code provides essential functions for manipulating an `IterableSet`, including checking subset/superset status, iterating through elements, draining the set, checking for containment, and inserting new elements. The use of generics allows for flexibility in the type of elements that can be stored, while the methods ensure that the set maintains its properties as a collection of unique items. This functionality is crucial for applications built on NEAR Protocol that require efficient data structures for managing state."}]}

Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n### Imports\n\n```rust\nuse near_gas::NearGas;\n```\n- This imports the `NearGas` struct from the `near_gas` crate, which is likely used for handling gas calculations in NEAR transactions.\n\n```rust\nuse crate::js_command_match::constants::{\n    DEFAULT_SEED_PHRASE_PATH, LEDGER_PATH_ALIASES, NETWORK_ID_ALIASES, SIGN_WITH_LEDGER_ALIASES,\n    USE_ACCOUNT_ALIASES,\n};\n```\n- This imports several constants from the `constants` module, which presumably define default values and aliases used throughout the command parsing.\n\n### Struct Definition\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Debug, Clone, clap::Parser)]\npub struct CallArgs {\n    contract_name: String,\n    method_name: String,\n    #[clap(default_value = \"{}\")]\n    args: String,\n    #[clap(long, aliases = USE_ACCOUNT_ALIASES)]\n    use_account: String,\n    #[clap(long, aliases = SIGN_WITH_LEDGER_ALIASES, default_value_t = false)]\n    sign_with_ledger: bool,\n    #[clap(long, aliases = LEDGER_PATH_ALIASES, default_value = DEFAULT_SEED_PHRASE_PATH)]\n    ledger_path: String,\n    #[clap(long, default_value_t = 30_000_000_000_000)]\n    gas: u64,\n    #[clap(long, default_value = \"0\")]\n    deposit: String,\n    #[clap(long, default_value = \"0\", conflicts_with = \"deposit\", aliases = [\"depositYocto\"])]\n    deposit_yocto: String,\n    #[clap(long, default_value_t = false)]\n    base64: bool,\n    #[clap(long, aliases = [\"privateKey\"])]\n    private_key: Option<String>,\n    #[clap(long, aliases = NETWORK_ID_ALIASES)]\n    network_id: Option<String>,\n}\n```\n- `CallArgs` struct is defined to hold command-line arguments.

This is crucial for validating the implementation and ensuring that any changes do not break functionality.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis code is designed to facilitate the interaction with NEAR smart contracts through a command-line interface. It defines a structured way to gather necessary parameters for calling a contract, converting them into a command format that can be executed to make transactions on the NEAR blockchain. The use of the `clap` library allows for flexible command-line argument parsing, making it user-friendly for developers interacting with the NEAR ecosystem."}]}

It seems to deal with signing transactions, managing Ethereum addresses, and integrating with the NEAR blockchain. Let's break down the main components of the code to clarify its functionality:\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n1. **Handling Action Arguments**:\n   ```typescript\n   if (!action.args) {\n     return;\n   }\n   if (Buffer.isBuffer(action.args)) {\n     action.args = \"0x\" + action.args.toString(\"hex\");\n     return;\n   }\n   Object.entries(action.args).forEach(([key, value]) => {\n     if (/receiver_id|account_id/g.test(key)) {\n       action.args[key] = RECEIVER_MARKER; // Replace with a marker\n       json.receivers.splice(i + 1, 0, value); // Store the original receiver/account id\n     }\n   });\n   ```\n\n   - The function checks if `action.args` exists. If not, it exits early.\n   - If `action.args` is a `Buffer`, it converts it to a hexadecimal string prefixed with \"0x\".\n   - It then iterates over the entries of `action.args`. If a key matches either `receiver_id` or `account_id`, it replaces that value with a `RECEIVER_MARKER` and stores the original value in a `json.receivers` array.\n\n2. **Packing Transactions**:\n   ```typescript\n   json.transactions = pack(\n     json.transactions.map(({ actions }) => pack(actions))\n   );\n   ```\n\n   - This line processes the `json.transactions` by packing each transaction's actions using a `pack` function, likely to prepare them for submission or storage.\n\n3. **Processing Receivers**:\n   ```typescript\n   if (json.receivers) {\n     const numReceivers = json.receivers.length.toString();\n     json.receivers = \n       HEADER_OFFSET + \n       json.receivers.join(\",\").length.toString().padStart(HEADER_PAD, \"0\") + \n       \"__\" + \n       json.receivers.join(\",\");\n     json.receivers = \n       json.receivers.substring(0, 4) + \n       numReceivers.padStart(3, \"0\") + \n       json.receivers.substring(7);\n   }\n   ```\n\n   - If there are any `json.receivers`, it processes them to create a formatted string that includes the count of receivers and prepares the string for further use (e.g., for signing or sending).\n   - `HEADER_OFFSET` and `HEADER_PAD` likely define how the header of the receivers string should be structured.\n\n4. **Signing the Data**:\n   ```typescript\n   const sig = await signer._signTypedData(domain, types, json);\n   ```\n\n   - This line asynchronously signs the `json` data using the specified `domain` and `types`, which are part of the EIP-712 standard for typed structured data signing in Ethereum.\n\n5. **Returning Arguments**:\n   ```typescript\n   const args = {\n     sig,\n     msg: json,\n   };\n   return args;\n   ```\n\n   - The function constructs an object containing the signature and the message (json) and returns it. This is likely used later for transaction submission or further processing.\n\n### Key Functions\n\n- **`getEthereum`**: This function detects and connects to an Ethereum provider (like MetaMask), switches to the specified Ethereum chain, and retrieves the user's Ethereum address.\n  \n- **`switchEthereum`**: This function requests permissions for Ethereum accounts and retrieves the user's Ethereum signer.\n\n- **`getNearMap`**: This function retrieves the NEAR account associated with a given Ethereum address by calling a method on a smart contract.\n\n- **`getNear`**: This function retrieves NEAR account information based on stored secrets and account IDs.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe code snippet primarily focuses on handling Ethereum and NEAR addresses and signing transactions. It includes logic to ensure that transaction arguments are processed correctly, prepares a structured message for signing, and facilitates the connection between Ethereum accounts and NEAR. The use of regular expressions, buffer handling, and structured data signing highlights the integration of multiple blockchain technologies, which is a common pattern in decentralized applications."}]}

It demonstrates the structure and functionality of a simple contract called `TestContract`. Below is a detailed explanation of each component of the code:\n\n### Imports\n```rust\nuse near_sdk::{env, near};\n```\n- This line imports necessary macros and utilities from the `near_sdk` crate. \n  - `env` provides access to the environment in which the contract is running (e.g., accessing state, reading input).\n  - `near` is a macro used to define NEAR contract-specific attributes.\n\n### Contract Definition\n```rust\n#[near(contract_state)]\npub struct TestContract {}\n```\n- This line defines a public struct `TestContract`. The `#[near(contract_state)]` attribute indicates that this struct will hold the state of the contract. Currently, it has no fields.\n\n### Default Implementation\n```rust\nimpl Default for TestContract {\n    fn default() -> Self {\n        Self {}\n    }\n}\n```\n- Here, the `Default` trait is implemented for `TestContract`. This allows the contract to be initialized with default values, which is useful for creating instances of the contract without needing to provide explicit initialization parameters.\n\n### Contract Methods\n```rust\n#[near]\nimpl TestContract {\n```\n- This block starts the implementation of the contract's methods.\n\n#### Constructor\n```rust\n    #[init]\n    pub fn new() -> Self {\n        Self {}\n    }\n```\n- The `new` function is marked with the `#[init]` attribute, indicating that it can only be called once when the contract is deployed. It initializes a new instance of `TestContract`.\n\n#### Migration Function\n```rust\n    #[init(ignore_state)]\n    pub fn migrate_state() -> Self {\n        #[near]\n        struct OldContract {\n            // ...\n        }\n\n        let _old_contract: OldContract = env::state_read().expect(\"Old state doesn't exist\");\n\n        Self {}\n    }\n```\n- The `migrate_state` function is also marked with `#[init]`, but it has the `ignore_state` attribute, meaning it does not require the contract state to be initialized beforehand. This is typically used when migrating from an old contract to a new one.\n- Inside this function, an `OldContract` struct is declared (commented out for brevity), which would presumably represent the state of the old contract.\n- The function attempts to read the old state using `env::state_read()`, and if it fails, it panics with the message \"Old state doesn't exist\".\n- Finally, it returns a new instance of `TestContract`.\n\n#### Panic Function\n```rust\n    pub fn test_panic_macro(&mut self) {\n        panic!(\"PANIC!\");\n    }\n```\n- This function demonstrates how a panic can be triggered within the contract. When called, it will cause the contract execution to fail with the message \"PANIC!\". This is useful for testing error handling and ensuring that the contract behaves correctly under failure conditions.\n\n### Unit Tests\n```rust\n#[cfg(not(target_arch = \"wasm32\"))]\n#[cfg(test)]\nmod tests {\n    use super::*;\n\n    #[test]\n    #[should_panic(expected = \"PANIC!\")]\n    fn test_panic() {\n        let mut contract = TestContract::new();\n        contract.test_panic_macro();\n    }\n}\n```\n- This block contains unit tests for the contract, which are only compiled and run when not targeting the WebAssembly architecture (which is how NEAR contracts run).\n- The `tests` module imports everything from the outer scope (the contract).\n- The `test_panic` function is a unit test marked with `#[test]`. It checks that calling `test_panic_macro` results in a panic. The `#[should_panic(expected = \"PANIC!\")]` attribute specifies that the test is expected to panic with the message \"PANIC!\", ensuring that the panic behavior is functioning as intended.\n\n### Summary\nOverall, this code snippet defines a simple NEAR smart contract with methods for initializing the contract, migrating old state, and testing panic behavior. It follows NEAR's conventions for contract structure, state management, and testing, demonstrating best practices for developing on the NEAR Protocol."}]}

In this case, several entities are being exported from the module.\n\n2. **Destructuring Export**:\n   - The curly braces `{}` indicate that specific items are being exported. This is known as a named export, where only the specified functions and constants are made available to other modules.\n\n3. **Functions and Constants Being Exported**:\n   - **`parseRpcError`**: A function likely used to parse RPC (Remote Procedure Call) errors returned from the NEAR blockchain, converting them into a more manageable format for the application.\n   - **`parseResultError`**: Similar to `parseRpcError`, this function likely handles errors that arise from parsed results, possibly transforming them into user-friendly error messages.\n   - **`formatError`**: A utility function that formats error messages for better readability or consistency. It might standardize the presentation of errors across the application.\n   - **`getErrorTypeFromErrorMessage`**: This function likely extracts or determines the type of error based on the error message provided, which can help in handling specific error types more effectively.\n   - **`ServerError`**: This might be a class or constant that represents server-related errors within the context of the NEAR API, allowing developers to handle server errors uniformly.\n\n4. **Source Module**:\n   - The `from '@near-js/utils'` part indicates that the exported functions and constant are sourced from the `@near-js/utils` package. This modular approach promotes code reusability and separation of concerns, allowing the core functionality to be maintained in a centralized module.\n\n### Purpose and Usage\n\nThe purpose of this export statement is to provide a clean and organized way to access error-handling utilities related to RPC calls in the NEAR ecosystem. By exporting these functions and constants from a single location, developers using the NEAR API can easily import them in their own modules, streamlining the process of error management when interacting with the NEAR blockchain.\n\n### Example Import\n\nHere’s how you might import these exports in another file:\n\n```javascript\nimport {\n    parseRpcError,\n    formatError,\n    ServerError\n} from './utils/rpc_errors';\n\n// Example usage\ntry {\n    // Some RPC call\n} catch (error) {\n    const parsedError = parseRpcError(error);\n    console.error(formatError(parsedError));\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the imported functions and constants are used to handle and format RPC errors, providing clearer error responses to developers or users of the application. This modular design improves code maintainability and readability."}]}

The snippet consists of a series of path data commands that describe the shape and appearance of the icon in an SVG format.\n\n### Breakdown of the Code Snippet\n\n1. **SVG Path Data**: The code consists of a long string of commands that make up the SVG path data. This data is used within an `<svg>` element to define shapes, lines, and curves. In SVG, path commands such as `M` (move to), `L` (line to), `C` (cubic Bezier curve), and others are used to create complex shapes.\n\n2. **Variables**: While the full context of the snippet is not provided, it is common in React components to define the SVG path data as a string or as a JavaScript variable. This data can be passed to an `<svg>` element or used with a library like `react-icons` or `@svgr/webpack` to render the SVG.\n\n3. **Purpose**: The purpose of this icon, as indicated by the name `LedgerDeviceIcon`, is to visually represent a Ledger hardware wallet, which is commonly used for securely managing cryptocurrency assets.

Let's break down the content of the snippet for better understanding:\n\n### Explanation of the Snippet\n\n1. **\"once the version is ticked\"**: \n   - This phrase indicates that there is a process in place where a version number is incremented or updated (often referred to as \"ticking\" the version). This is a common practice in software development to signify that there are new features, bug fixes, or other changes that justify a new release.\n\n2. **\"crate will be published and tagged\"**:\n   - In the context of Rust programming, a \"crate\" refers to a package of Rust code. When the version is updated, the crate (the package) will be published to a package registry (like [crates.io](https://crates.io/)). \n   - \"Tagged\" refers to the practice of adding a version tag in the version control system (e.g., Git). This allows developers to easily reference this particular version of the codebase in the future.\n\n3. **\"and then binary release pipeline will kick in\"**:\n   - After the crate is published and tagged, a \"binary release pipeline\" is activated. This means that a series of automated processes will start that are responsible for building, testing, and packaging the software into executable binaries. These binaries are what users or other systems will ultimately use to run the software. The pipeline may include steps like compiling the code, running tests, and creating installer packages.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, this snippet describes a part of the release process for a software project using Rust. When a new version is indicated (or \"ticked\"), the crate is published, tagged for version control, and an automated pipeline is initiated to create binaries for distribution. This process helps ensure that the software is updated and easily accessible to users while maintaining a clear history of changes through version tagging. \n\nIf you have any further questions or need more details about a specific part of the release process, feel free to ask!"}]}

Can be used by other frontends for initial retrieval of assets, even if these frontends then replicate the data to their own decentralized nodes, which they are encouraged to do.\n\n### An implementing contract MAY include the following fields on-chain\n\nFor `NFTContractMetadata`:\n\n- `icon`: a small image associated with this contract. Encouraged to be a [data URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs), to help consumers display it quickly while protecting user data. Recommendation: use [optimized SVG](https://codepen.io/tigt/post/optimizing-svgs-in-data-uris), which can result in high-resolution images with only 100s of bytes of [storage cost](https://docs.near.org/concepts/storage/storage-staking). (Note that these storage costs are incurred to the contract deployer, but that querying these icons is a very cheap & cacheable read operation for all consumers of the contract and the RPC nodes that serve the data.) Recommendation: create icons that will work well with both light-mode and dark-mode websites by either using middle-tone color schemes, or by [embedding `media` queries in the SVG](https://timkadlec.com/2013/04/media-queries-within-svg/).\n- `reference`: a link to a valid JSON file containing various keys offering supplementary details on the token. Example: \"/ipfs/QmdmQXB2mzChmMeKY47C43LxUdg1NDJ5MWcKMKxDu7RgQm\", \"https://example.com/token.json\", etc. If the information given in this document conflicts with the on-chain attributes, the values in `reference` shall be considered the source of truth.\n- `reference_hash`: the base64-encoded sha256 hash of the JSON file contained in the `reference` field. This is to guard against off-chain tampering.\n\nFor `TokenMetadata`:\n\n- `name`:  The name of this specific token.\n- `description`: A longer description of the token.\n- `media`: URL to associated media. Preferably to decentralized, content-addressed storage.\n- `media_hash`: the base64-encoded sha256 hash of content referenced by the `media` field. This is to guard against off-chain tampering.\n- `copies`: The number of tokens with this set of metadata or `media` known to exist at time of minting.\n- `issued_at`: Unix epoch in milliseconds when token was issued or minted (an unsigned 32-bit integer would suffice until the year 2106)\n- `expires_at`: Unix epoch in milliseconds when token expires\n- `starts_at`: Unix epoch in milliseconds when token starts being valid\n- `updated_at`: Unix epoch in milliseconds when token was last updated\n- `extra`: anything extra the NFT wants to store on-chain. Can be stringified JSON.\n- `reference`: URL to an off-chain JSON file with more info.\n- `reference_hash`: Base64-encoded sha256 hash of JSON from reference field. Required if `reference` is included.\n\n### No incurred cost for core NFT behavior\n\nContracts should be implemented in a way to avoid extra gas fees for serialization & deserialization of metadata for calls to `nft_*` methods other than `nft_metadata` or `nft_token`.

Frontends can account for this by adding extra deposit when minting. This could be done by padding with a reasonable amount, or by the frontend using the [RPC call```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The code snippet from the NEAR Enhancement Proposal (NEP) 177 outlines the metadata structure for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the NEAR Protocol. It specifies the fields that can be included in the NFT contract's metadata and provides guidelines for their implementation. Here's a breakdown of the important components:\n\n### Key Metadata Fields\n\n1. **General Contract Metadata:**\n   - **`symbol`**: This is a short identifier for the NFT contract, similar to stock ticker symbols (e.g., MOCHI, MV3). It helps users quickly recognize the token.\n   - **`base_uri`**: A URL pointing to a centralized location where assets can be reliably accessed. This is important for decentralized storage, allowing frontends to initially retrieve assets before potentially caching them on decentralized nodes.\n\n2. **NFTContractMetadata Fields:**\n   - **`icon`**: A small image used to represent the contract. It’s advisable to use a data URL for quick loading and to protect user data. Optimized SVG is recommended due to its efficiency in storage and quality.\n   - **`reference`**: This is a URL to a JSON file that contains supplementary information about the NFT. It serves as the authoritative source for metadata in case of discrepancies with on-chain attributes.\n   - **`reference_hash`**: A SHA256 hash of the JSON file in the `reference` field, encoded in base64. This ensures that the off-chain data has not been tampered with.\n\n3. **TokenMetadata Fields:**\n   - **`name`**: The name of the individual token.\n   - **`description`**: A longer text providing details about the token.\n   - **`media`**: A URL to the media associated with the token, preferably stored in a decentralized manner.\n   - **`media_hash`**: A hash of the media content to prevent tampering.\n   - **`copies`**: Indicates how many tokens share the same metadata at the time of minting.\n   - **`issued_at`, `expires_at`, `starts_at`, `updated_at`**: Timestamps in Unix epoch format representing various events in the token's lifecycle.\n   - **`extra`**: A flexible field for additional information that can be stored as stringified JSON.\n   - **`reference`** and **`reference_hash`**: Similar to NFTContractMetadata, they provide links and hashes for additional off-chain data.\n\n### Cost Considerations\nThe proposal emphasizes that while using the extended metadata structure increases the storage cost per token compared to a simpler NFT contract, careful design can mitigate extra gas fees for core NFT behaviors. It suggests implementing serialization and deserialization of metadata efficiently to avoid incurring unnecessary costs during method calls that do not involve `nft_metadata` or `nft_token`.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\nThe NEP encourages developers to refer to existing implementations, specifically mentioning the NEAR SDK's `LazyOption`, as a model for efficient design practices. \n\n### Example Structure\nTo illustrate how this metadata could be structured in a Rust contract, here is a simple example:\n\n```rust\nuse near_sdk::serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};\nuse near_sdk::json_types::Base64Vecu8;\n\n// Struct for NFT Contract Metadata\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]\npub struct NFTContractMetadata {\n    pub symbol: String,\n    pub base_uri: String,\n    pub icon: Option<String>, // Optional icon image\n    pub reference: Option<String>, // URL to additional metadata\n    pub reference_hash: Option<Base64Vecu8>, // Hash of the reference data\n}\n\n// Struct for Token Metadata\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]\npub struct TokenMetadata {\n    pub name: String,\n    pub description: String,\n    pub media: Option<String>, // Media URL\n    pub media_hash: Option<Base64Vecu8>, // Hash of the media content\n    pub copies: Option<u32>, // Total copies of this token\n    pub issued_at: u64, // Timestamp for when the token was minted\n    pub expires_at: Option<u64>, // Expiry time\n    pub starts_at: Option<u64>, // Start validity time\n    pub updated_at: u64, // Last updated time\n    pub extra: Option<String>, // Extra JSON data\n    pub reference: Option<String>, // URL to off-chain data\n    pub reference_hash: Option<Base64Vecu8>, // Hash of the reference data\n}\n```\n\n### Drawbacks\nThe proposal notes that the storage requirements for this richer metadata structure are higher than simpler implementations, meaning frontends should account for this by possibly requiring a larger deposit when minting new tokens to cover the increased costs.\n\nBy clearly defining and structuring the NFT metadata, NEP 177 aims to enhance the usability and interoperability of NFTs on the NEAR Protocol while maintaining a focus on security through data integrity checks."}]}

Strictly typed for each set {standard, version, event} inside corresponding NEP\ninterface EventLogData {\n  standard: string;\n  version: string;\n  event: string;\n  data?: unknown;\n}\n```\n\nThus, to emit an event, you only need to log a string following the rules above. Here is a bare-bones example using Rust SDK `near_sdk::log!` macro (security note: prefer using `serde_json` or alternatives to serialize the JSON string to avoid potential injections and corrupted events):\n\n```rust\nuse near_sdk::log;\n\n// ...\nlog!(\n    r#\"EVENT_JSON:{\"standard\": \"nepXXX\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"event\": \"YYY\", \"data\": {\"token_id\": \"{}\"}}\"#,\n    token_id\n);\n// ...\n```\n\n#### Valid event logs\n\n```js\nEVENT_JSON:{\n    \"standard\": \"nepXXX\",\n    \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n    \"event\": \"xyz_is_triggered\"\n}\n```\n\n```js\nEVENT_JSON:{\n    \"standard\": \"nepXXX\",\n    \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n    \"event\": \"xyz_is_triggered\",\n    \"data\": {\n        \"triggered_by\": \"foundation.near\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Invalid event logs\n\n- Two events in a single log entry (instead, call `log` for each individual event)\n\n```js\nEVENT_JSON:{\n    \"standard\": \"nepXXX\",\n    \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n    \"event\": \"abc_is_triggered\"\n}\nEVENT_JSON:{\n    \"standard\": \"nepXXX\",\n    \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n    \"event\": \"xyz_is_triggered\"\n}\n```\n\n- Invalid JSON data\n\n```js\nEVENT_JSON:invalid json\n```\n\n- Missing required fields `standard`, `version` or `event`\n\n```js\nEVENT_JSON:{\n    \"standard\": \"nepXXX\",\n    \"event\": \"xyz_is_triggered\",\n    \"data\": {\n        \"triggered_by\": \"foundation.near\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Reference Implementation\n\n[Fungible Token Events Implementation](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs/blob/master/near-contract-standards/src/fungible_token/events.rs)\n\n[Non-Fungible Token Events Implementation](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs/blob/master/near-contract-standards/src/non_fungible_token/events.rs)\n\n## Drawbacks\n\nThere is a known limitation of 16kb strings when capturing logs.\nThis impacts the amount of events that can be```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This code snippet outlines NEP-297, a proposal for standardizing event logging in smart contracts on the NEAR Protocol. Here's a detailed breakdown of its components and significance:\n\n### NEP Metadata\n\n- **NEP**: This indicates the NEP number, in this case, `297`.\n- **Title**: The title of the NEP, which is \"Events\".\n- **Author**: The author of the NEP, providing a point of contact for inquiries.\n- **DiscussionsTo**: A link to the GitHub issue where discussions about this NEP took place.\n- **Status**: Indicates that the NEP is in a \"Final\" state.\n- **Type**: This specifies that it's a \"Standards Track\" NEP, indicating it aims to define a standard.\n- **Category**: Categorized under \"Contract\", highlighting its relevance to smart contracts.\n- **Created**: The date the NEP was created, which is 03-Mar-2022.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe summary states that this NEP establishes a standard format for logging events related to contract activities. It indicates that this standard is a foundational component that supports other NEPs, such as NEP-141 (Fungible Tokens) and NEP-171 (Non-Fungible Tokens).\n\n### Motivation\n\nThe motivation section explains the need for a consistent way to log and track events across different applications. It highlights that without a standardized method, tracking state changes across various applications can become problematic. The goal is to enable NEAR and third-party applications to monitor these events effectively.\n\n### Rationale and Alternatives\n\nHere, the NEP would typically discuss why the proposed design is preferable to alternative designs, what other designs were considered, and the consequences of not implementing this standard. However, this section is left largely empty in the snippet.\n\n### Specification\n\nThe specification details how events should be structured. It emphasizes that all event logs must start with the `EVENT_JSON:` prefix followed by a valid JSON string. The JSON structure must conform to the `EventLogData` interface, which includes:\n\n- `standard`: The name of the standard (e.g., `nep171`).\n- `version`: The version of the standard (e.g., `1.0.0`).\n- `event`: The type of event being logged (e.g., `nft_mint`).\n- `data`: Optional additional data associated with the event.\n\n#### Example of Logging an Event\n\nThe example shows how to log an event using the NEAR Rust SDK's `log!` macro. It highlights the importance of using serialization libraries like `serde_json` to prevent injection attacks and ensure valid JSON formatting.\n\n```rust\nuse near_sdk::log;\n\n// Logging an event of type YYY with a token ID\nlog!(\n    r#\"EVENT_JSON:{\"standard\": \"nepXXX\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"event\": \"YYY\", \"data\": {\"token_id\": \"{}\"}}\"#,\n    token_id\n);\n```\n\n### Valid and Invalid Event Logs\n\nThe NEP provides examples of both valid and invalid event logs to clarify the expected format. \n\n- **Valid Logs**:\n    - Simple event without additional data.\n    - Event with additional context in the `data` field.\n\n- **Invalid Logs**:\n    - Multiple events in a single log entry (each event must be logged individually).\n    - Invalid JSON format.\n    - Missing required fields (`standard`, `version`, or `event`).\n\n### Reference Implementations\n\nLinks to implementations of event logging for fungible and non-fungible tokens are provided as practical examples for developers to reference.\n\n### Drawbacks\n\nThe NEP notes a limitation regarding the maximum log size of 16kb, which could restrict the amount of event data that can be captured in a single log entry.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nNEP-297 provides a crucial framework for standardizing event logging in NEAR smart contracts. This standardization facilitates better interoperability and tracking of events across various applications, making it easier for developers and users to monitor and react to changes in contract states. By adhering to this specification, developers can ensure their applications are consistent and compatible with the broader NEAR ecosystem."}]}

This function is crucial in the context of transferring NFTs and provides a mechanism for handling the transfer process, especially when interacting with contracts that may process these tokens further.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the code and its components:\n\n### Function Definition\n\n```typescript\nfunction nft_on_transfer(\n  sender_id: string,\n  previous_owner_id: string,\n  token_id: string,\n  msg: string,\n): Promise<boolean>;\n```\n\n#### Parameters Explained:\n\n1. **`sender_id: string`**: \n   - This is the ID of the account that initiated the transfer of the NFT. It represents the entity that is sending the token.\n\n2. **`previous_owner_id: string`**: \n   - The ID of the account that owned the token before the transfer. This allows the receiving contract to verify the ownership history and manage state accordingly.\n\n3. **`token_id: string`**: \n   - The unique identifier for the NFT being transferred. Each NFT has a distinct `token_id`, which is essential in differentiating between various tokens.\n\n4. **`msg: string`**: \n   - This parameter contains additional information that the receiving contract needs to process the transfer request. It can include method names and arguments that guide the contract on how to handle the incoming token.\n\n#### Return Value:\n\n- The function returns a `Promise<boolean>`, indicating whether the token should be returned to the `sender_id`. This implies that after processing the transfer, the contract has the option to return the token back to the sender based on certain conditions.\n\n### Contextual Notes\n\nThe comments preceding the function definition mention important considerations regarding the use of the contract, particularly in relation to the **Approval Management** extension. This extension allows accounts to approve other accounts to manage their NFTs without transferring ownership, which can complicate the `sender_id` and `previous_owner_id` relationships.\n\n### Errata Section\n\nThe errata section provides a history of changes made to the function's definition and related structures, highlighting important updates that ensure consistency and correctness in the implementation of the NFT standard:\n\n- **2022-11-21**: Indicates that the `approval_id` parameter should also be considered optional.\n- **2022-02-03**: Details a change in the naming convention from `id` to `token_id` for clarity and consistency with the standard.\n- **2021-12-20**: Discusses a type change in the `nft_resolve_transfer` function, allowing contracts to restore original approved accounts more efficiently.\n- **2021-07-16**: Adjusts the type of `approval_id` to reflect that it's a number, ensuring compliance with JavaScript's handling of numbers and the JSON limits.\n\n### References\n\nThe snippet also includes links to relevant specifications and concepts such as:\n\n- **ERC-721**: A widely recognized standard for NFTs on Ethereum.\n- **Storage Staking**: NEAR's approach to managing storage costs for contracts.\n- **Gas**: The concept of transaction fees within the NEAR framework.\n- **Metadata**: Additional data associated with NFTs.\n- **Approval Management**: Details on how approvals work in the context of NFT transfers.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis function is an integral part of the NFT transfer mechanism in the NEAR Protocol, allowing for complex interactions between tokens and contracts. Understanding this function is key for developers working with NFTs on NEAR, as it lays the groundwork for handling token transfers and ensuring that contracts behave as expected during these operations."}]}

Now this signed transaction can be sent to a node.\n- The RPC interface receives the transaction and routes it to the correct physical node using `signer_id`.  Since the `signer_id` must be a NEAR Account ID which lives on a single shard, the account is mapped to a shard which is followed by at least one validator running at least one machine with an IP address.\n- When a node receives a new signed transaction, it validates the transaction for signer, receiver, account balance, cost overflow, signature, etc. ([see here](https://nomicon.io/RuntimeSpec/Scenarios/FinancialTransaction.html#transaction-to-receipt)) and gossips it to all peers following the same shard. If a transaction has an invalid signature or would be invalid on the latest state, it is rejected quickly and returns an error to the original RPC call. \n- Valid transactions are added to the transaction pool (every validating node has its own independent copy of a transaction pool). The transaction pool maintains transactions that are not yet discarded and not yet included into the chain.\n- A pool iterator is used to pick transactions from the pool one at a time, ordered from the smallest nonce to largest, until the pool is drained or some chunk limit is reached (max number of transactions per chunk or max gas burnt per chunk to process transactions).  Please refer to articles on the [pool iterator](https://nomicon.io/ChainSpec/Transactions.html?highlight=pool#pool-iterator) and [gas](/concepts/protocol/gas) for more details.\n- To accommodate the distributed nature of a sharded blockchain, all transactions are subsequently returned to a segmented transaction pool having 3 distinct layers: accepted transactions (which will be processed on the next chunk), pending transactions (which exceeded the limits of the current chunk and will be included in a later round of processing) and invalid transactions (which will be rejected at the next available opportunity).\n- Before producing a chunk, transactions are ordered and validated again. This is done to produce chunks with only valid transactions across a distributed system.\n- While a transaction is being processed on to a chunk, any errors raised by the application of its actions are also returned via RPC.\n\n\n## NEAR Platform Errors {#near-platform-errors}\n\nErrors raised by the NEAR platform are implemented in the following locations in `nearcore`:\n\n- [nearcore/core/primitives/src/errors.rs](https://github.com/near/nearcore/blob/master/core/primitives/src/errors.rs)\n- [nearcore/runtime/near-vm-errors/src/lib.rs](https://github.com/near/nearcore/blob/master/runtime/near-vm-errors/src/lib.rs)\n\nThis page includes: \n- **RuntimeError and subtypes**: errors raised when a transaction is first received by the destination node and again before it's processed and applied to a chunk\n- **TxExecutionError and subtypes**: errors raised while a transaction and its component action(s) are being validated and applied to a chunk\n- **VMerror and subtypes**: errors raised during the execution of a Wasm contract by the NEAR VM\n\n### RuntimeError and subtypes {#runtimeerror-and-subtypes}\n\n```text\nRuntimeError                                              Error returned from `Runtime::apply  \n  StorageError                                            Unexpected error which is typically related to the node storage corruption.account\n  BalanceMismatchError                                    An error happens if `check_balance` fails, which is likely an indication of an invalid state\n  InvalidTxError                                          An error happened during TX verification and account charging\n    InvalidAccessKeyError                                 Describes the error for validating access key\n    ActionsValidationError                                Describes the error for validating a list of actions    \n      TotalPrepaidGasExceeded                             The total prepaid gas (for all given actions) exceeded the limit.\n      TotalNumberOfActionsExceeded                        The number of actions exceeded the given limit.\n      AddKeyMethodNamesNumberOfBytesExceeded              The total number of bytes of the method names exceeded the limit in a Add Key action.\n      AddKeyMethodNameLengthExceeded                      The length of some method name exceeded the limit in a Add Key action.\n      IntegerOverflow                                     Integer overflow during a compute.\n      InvalidAccountId                                    Invalid account ID.\n      ContractSizeExceeded                                The size of the contract code exceeded the limit in a DeployContract action.\n      FunctionCallMethodNameLengthExceeded                The length of the method name exceeded the limit in a Function Call action.\n      FunctionCallArgumentsLength```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The provided code snippet is a Markdown document that serves as an introduction to the life cycle of transactions and error handling within the NEAR Protocol.

The use of HTML for the blockquote indicates that this document is likely rendered in a web context where custom styling can be applied.\n\n3. **Life of a Transaction**:\n   The section titled `## The life of a transaction:` outlines the step-by-step process of how a transaction is created, validated, and processed in the NEAR blockchain. Here’s a breakdown of each step:\n\n   - **Transaction Creation**:\n     - A client initiates a transaction, computes its hash, and signs it. This signed transaction is ready to be sent to a node.\n\n   - **Routing via RPC**:\n     - The Remote Procedure Call (RPC) interface receives the transaction and routes it to the correct node using the `signer_id`, which must correspond to an existing NEAR Account ID. The account is mapped to a specific shard, which is crucial for the sharding architecture of NEAR.\n\n   - **Transaction Validation**:\n     - Upon receiving a signed transaction, the node performs various validations, such as checking the signature, balances, and ensuring it’s valid against the latest state. Invalid transactions are rejected early, providing a quick feedback loop to the client.\n\n   - **Transaction Pool**:\n     - Valid transactions are stored in a transaction pool, which is maintained independently by each validating node. This pool holds transactions that are pending inclusion in the blockchain.\n\n   - **Pool Iteration**:\n     - Transactions are picked from the pool based on their nonce (a unique identifier for each transaction from an account), ensuring they are processed in the correct order. This iteration continues until the pool is empty or certain limits are reached.\n\n   - **Segmented Transaction Pool**:\n     - Transactions are categorized into three layers: accepted, pending, and invalid, to manage their state before inclusion in a chunk (a group of transactions processed together).\n\n   - **Final Validation Before Chunk Production**:\n     - Transactions are re-validated before being added to a chunk to ensure that only valid transactions are processed.\n\n   - **Error Reporting**:\n     - If any errors occur while processing a transaction, they are returned through the RPC interface, allowing the client to handle them appropriately.\n\n4. **NEAR Platform Errors**:\n   This section outlines where to find the error definitions within the NEAR core codebase. It lists various categories of errors that can occur at different stages of transaction processing, including:\n   - **RuntimeError**: Errors that occur when a transaction is received and before it's processed.\n   - **TxExecutionError**: Errors during the validation and application of a transaction’s actions.\n   - **VMerror**: Errors that arise during the execution of WebAssembly (Wasm) contracts.\n\n5. **RuntimeError and Subtypes**:\n   The document provides a list of specific errors that fall under `RuntimeError`, detailing the nature of each error and the conditions under which they occur. For example:\n   - `BalanceMismatchError` indicates an issue with account balance checks.\n   - `InvalidTxError` covers errors related to transaction verification.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis Markdown document serves as an introductory guide to understanding how transactions are handled in the NEAR Protocol and the potential errors that can arise. It is aimed at developers and technical readers who need to grasp the lifecycle of transactions and how to manage errors effectively within the NEAR ecosystem. The structured approach allows readers to follow the flow of transactions clearly and locate relevant information about errors efficiently. \n\nIf you have any specific questions or need further elaboration on certain parts of the document, feel free to ask!"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain the following code snippet from NEAR repository file `docs/3.tutorials/nfts/9-series.md`:\n``` can be minted.\n:::\n\nWe've also added a field `tokens` which keeps track of all the token IDs that have been minted for this series. This allows us to deal with the potential `copies` cap by checking the length of the set. It also allows us to paginate through all the tokens in the series.\n\n<hr class=\"subsection\" />\n\n### Creating Series\n\n`series.rs` is a new file that replaces the old [minting](2-minting.md) logic. This file has been created to combine both the series creation and minting logic into one.\n\n<Github language=\"rust\" start=\"10\" end=\"56\" url=\"https://github.com/near-examples/nft-tutorial/blob/main/nft-series/src/series.rs\" />\n\nThe function takes in a series ID in the form of a [u64](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.u64.html), the metadata, royalties, and the price for tokens in the series. It will then create the [Series object](#series-object) and insert it into the contract's series_by_id data structure. It's important to note that the caller must be an approved creator and they must attach enough $NEAR to cover storage costs.\n\n<hr class=\"subsection\" />\n\n### Minting NFTs\n\nNext, we'll look at the minting function. If you remember from before, this used to take the following parameters:\n- Token ID\n- Metadata\n- Receiver ID\n- Perpetual Royalties\n\nWith the new and improved minting function, these parameters have been changed to just two:\n- The series ID\n- The receiver ID.\n\nThe mint function might look complicated at first but let's break it down to understand what's happening. The first thing it does is get the [series object](#series-object) from the specified series ID. From there, it will check that the number of copies won't be exceeded if one is specified in the metadata.\n\nIt will then store the token information on the contract as explained in the [minting section](2-minting.md#storage-implications) of the tutorial and map the token ID to the series. Once this is finished, a mint log will be emitted and it will ensure that enough deposit has been attached to the call. This amount differs based on whether or not the series has a price.\n\n#### Required Deposit\n\nAs we went over in the [minting section](2-minting.md#storage-implications) of this tutorial, all information stored on the contract costs $NEAR. When minting, there is a required deposit to pay for this storage. For *this contract*, a series price can also be specified by the owner when the series is created. This price will be used for **all** NFTs in the series when they are minted. If the price is specified, the deposit must cover both the storage as well as the price.\n\nIf a price **is specified** and the user attaches more deposit than what is necessary, the excess is sent to the **series owner**. There is also *no restriction* on who can mint tokens for series that have a price. The caller does **not** need to be an approved minter.\n\nIf **no price** was specified in the series and the user attaches more deposit than what is necessary, the excess is *refunded to them*. In addition, the contract makes sure that the caller is an approved minter in this case.\n\n:::info\nNotice how the token ID isn't required? This is because the token ID is automatically generated when minting. The ID stored on the contract is `${series_id}:${token_id}` where the token ID is a nonce that increases each time a new token is minted in a series. This not only reduces the amount of information stored on the contract but it also acts as a way to check the specific edition number.\n:::\n\n<Github language=\"rust\" start=\"60\" end=\"147\" url=\"https://github.com/near-examples/nft-tutorial/blob/main/nft-series/src/series.rs\" />\n\n<hr class=\"subsection\" />\n\n### View Functions\n\nNow that we've introduced the idea of series, more view functions have also been added.\n\n:::info\nNotice how we've also created a new struct `JsonSeries` instead of returning the regular `Series` struct. This is because the `Series` struct contains an `UnorderedSet` which cannot be serialized.\n\nThe common practice is to return everything **except** the `UnorderedSet` in a separate struct and then have entirely different methods for accessing the data from the `UnorderedSet` itself.\n<!-- TODO: add a learn more here call to action -->\n:::\n\n<Github language=\"rust\" start=\"6\" end=\"17\" url=\"https://github.com/near-examples/nft-tutorial/blob/main/nft```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! The provided code snippet is part of the NEAR Protocol NFT tutorial, specifically focusing on the implementation of NFT series and the minting process. Let's break down the key components and concepts mentioned in the snippet:\n\n### Overview of the Code Snippet\n\n1. **Tokens Tracking**:\n   - The snippet mentions a field called `tokens` that keeps track of all the token IDs minted for a particular series. This is essential for:\n     - Managing a cap on the number of copies that can be minted.\n     - Implementing pagination for the tokens in the series, allowing users to retrieve tokens efficiently.\n\n2. **Creating Series**:\n   - The `series.rs` file consolidates the logic for creating NFT series and minting tokens into a single file. This improves organization and maintainability of the code.\n   - When creating a series, the function takes in:\n     - `series_id`: A unique identifier for the series (type `u64`).\n     - `metadata`: Information about the series (e.g., title, description).\n     - `royalties`: Information on royalties to be paid when the NFT is sold.\n     - `price`: The cost at which tokens can be minted in this series.\n   - The series is then stored in a data structure called `series_by_id`, ensuring that it can be easily accessed later.\n\n3. **Minting NFTs**:\n   - The minting function's parameters have been simplified:\n     - **Old Parameters**: Token ID, Metadata, Receiver ID, Perpetual Royalties.\n     - **New Parameters**: Series ID, Receiver ID.\n   - The minting process involves:\n     - Retrieving the `Series` object based on the provided `series_id`.\n     - Checking if the number of copies to be minted exceeds any specified limit.\n     - Storing the token information within the contract.\n     - Emitting a mint log for tracking purposes.\n   - **Required Deposit**:\n     - The contract requires a deposit in $NEAR to cover storage costs. If a price is specified for the series, the deposit must cover both storage and the price of the NFT.\n     - If the user sends more than necessary, the excess is handled differently based on whether a price is specified:\n       - If a price is specified, excess funds are sent to the series owner.\n       - If no price is set, excess funds are refunded to the user.\n\n4. **Token ID Generation**:\n   - The token ID is automatically generated in the format `${series_id}:${token_id}`. The `token_id` acts as a nonce, ensuring uniqueness for each minted token in the series and also indicating its edition number.\n\n5. **View Functions**:\n   - The snippet introduces a new struct `JsonSeries` for returning data, instead of using the original `Series` struct directly. This is necessary because the `Series` struct contains an `UnorderedSet`, which cannot be serialized for API responses.\n   - The best practice is to create separate structs for serialization that exclude complex data types like `UnorderedSet`.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis code snippet demonstrates the implementation of an NFT series within the NEAR Protocol, emphasizing efficient tracking of minted tokens, simplified minting logic, and careful handling of deposits for storage costs. It also highlights the importance of structuring data for API interactions, ensuring that only necessary information is exposed while keeping the underlying implementation details hidden.\n\n### Example Code Context\n\nHere's an illustrative example of how the minting function might look in Rust:\n\n```rust\n#[near_bindgen]\nimpl Contract {\n    pub fn mint_nft(&mut self, series_id: u64, receiver_id: AccountId) {\n        // Fetch the series object from storage\n        let series = self.series_by_id.get(&series_id).expect(\"Series not found\");\n        \n        // Ensure the number of copies does not exceed the limit\n        assert!(series.tokens.len() < series.copies, \"Copy limit reached\");\n        \n        // Automatically generate the token ID\n        let token_id = series.tokens.len() as u64 + 1;\n        let full_token_id = format!(\"{}:{}\", series_id, token_id);\n        \n        // Store token information\n        self.tokens.insert(&full_token_id, &token_metadata);\n        series.tokens.insert(full_token_id.clone());\n        \n        // Emit mint event (not shown)\n        \n        // Handle required deposit logic (not shown)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code snippet represents an oversimplified version of the minting function, illustrating the key steps involved in the process."}]}

Below is a detailed breakdown of the code, highlighting its components and functionality.\n\n### Overview of the Code\n\n1. **Imports**: The code begins by importing necessary traits and modules:\n   - `BorshDeserialize` and `BorshSerialize`: Traits for serializing and deserializing data structures.\n   - `Bound`: A standard library type that can define bounds for ranges.\n\n2. **TreeMap Documentation**: \n   The `TreeMap` is documented to indicate its runtime complexity:\n   - `get` and `contains_key` operations have average time complexity of O(1) due to the underlying `LookupMap`.\n   - `insert`, `remove`, `min`, `max`, `above`, and `below` operations run in O(log(N)), which is typical for AVL trees.\n   - Range operations that retrieve K elements run in O(K log(N)).\n\n3. **TreeMap Struct**: \n   The `TreeMap` struct is defined with two main fields:\n   - `root`: This holds the identifier for the root node.\n   - `val`: A `LookupMap<K, V>` that stores the value associated with each key.\n   - `tree`: A `Vector<Node<K>>` that keeps the nodes of the AVL tree.\n\n   The serialization and deserialization constraints for `val` and `tree` are conditionally compiled based on the presence of the `abi` feature.\n\n4. **Node Struct**: \n   The `Node` struct represents a single node in the AVL tree:\n   - `id`: A unique identifier for the node.\n   - `key`: The key associated with the node.\n   - `lft` and `rgt`: Optional references to the left and right children, respectively.\n   - `ht`: The height of the subtree rooted at this node.\n\n5. **Node Implementation**: \n   The `Node` struct has a constructor method `of`, which initializes a new node with an ID and key, setting the left and right children to `None` and height to `1`.\n\n6. **TreeMap Implementation**:\n   - **Constructor (`new`)**: This method initializes a new `TreeMap` with a given storage prefix. It sets the `root` to 0 and initializes the `val` and `tree` fields using the provided prefix.\n   - **`len` Method**: Returns the number of elements in the tree by checking the length of the `tree` vector.\n   - **`is_empty` Method**: Checks if the tree is empty.\n   - **`clear` Method**: Clears the tree by resetting the root and removing all nodes from both the `val` LookupMap and the `tree` vector.\n   - **Internal Methods**: \n     - `node`: Fetches a node by its ID from the tree vector.\n     - `save`: Intended to save a node (the code snippet is incomplete here).\n\n### Example Usage\n\nThe comments in the code provide examples of how to use the `TreeMap`:\n\n```rust\n// Creating a new TreeMap\nuse near_sdk::collections::TreeMap;\nlet mut tree: TreeMap<u32, u32> = TreeMap::new(b\"t\");\n\n// Inserting elements\ntree.insert(&1, &10);\ntree.insert(&2, &20);\n\n// Getting the length of the tree\nassert_eq!(tree.len(), 2);\n\n// Clearing the tree\ntree.clear();\nassert_eq!(tree.len(), 0);\n```\n\n### Summary\n\nThis code snippet provides the foundational structure and methods for a `TreeMap` that operates on an AVL tree, allowing efficient key-value storage and retrieval while ensuring that the tree remains balanced for optimal performance. The use of Borsh for serialization makes it suitable for blockchain environments like NEAR, where efficient data storage and retrieval are critical."}]}

Below, I will explain the main components and functionality of the code.\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n1. **Imports and Attributes**:\n   ```rust\n   #[derive(Debug, Clone, interactive_clap::InteractiveClap)]\n   #[interactive_clap(input_context = super::super::NewAccountContext)]\n   #[interactive_clap(output_context = AddPublicKeyActionContext)]\n   ```\n   - The `#[derive(Debug, Clone, interactive_clap::InteractiveClap)]` macro automatically implements the `Debug` and `Clone` traits for the struct `AddPublicKeyAction`, allowing instances of this struct to be debug-printed and cloned.\n   - The `interactive_clap` attribute specifies that this struct is used in an interactive command-line interface (CLI). It takes `NewAccountContext` as input and will produce `AddPublicKeyActionContext` as output.\n\n2. **Struct Definition**:\n   ```rust\n   pub struct AddPublicKeyAction {\n       /// Enter the public key for this account:\n       public_key: crate::types::public_key::PublicKey,\n       #[interactive_clap(named_arg)]\n       /// What is the signer account ID?\n       sign_as: super::super::sign_as::SignerAccountId,\n   }\n   ```\n   - `AddPublicKeyAction` is a struct that captures the necessary information to add a public key to an account.\n   - It contains:\n     - `public_key`: The public key that will be associated with the new account, using the `PublicKey` type defined in the `types` module.\n     - `sign_as`: A `SignerAccountId`, which represents the account that will be signing the transaction to create the account.\n\n3. **Context Struct**:\n   ```rust\n   #[derive(Clone)]\n   pub struct AddPublicKeyActionContext(super::super::AccountPropertiesContext);\n   ```\n   - `AddPublicKeyActionContext` is a new context struct that wraps around `AccountPropertiesContext`. This allows it to carry additional information relevant to the action of adding a public key.\n\n4. **Context Initialization**:\n   ```rust\n   impl AddPublicKeyActionContext {\n       pub fn from_previous_context(\n           previous_context: super::super::NewAccountContext,\n           scope: &<AddPublicKeyAction as interactive_clap::ToInteractiveClapContextScope>::InteractiveClapContextScope,\n       ) -> color_eyre::eyre::Result<Self> {\n           let account_properties = super::super::AccountProperties {\n               new_account_id: previous_context.new_account_id,\n               initial_balance: previous_context.initial_balance,\n               public_key: scope.public_key.clone().into(),\n           };\n\n           Ok(Self(super::super::AccountPropertiesContext {\n               global_context: previous_context.global_context,\n               account_properties,\n               on_before_sending_transaction_callback: std::sync::Arc::new(\n                   |_signed_transaction, _network_config| Ok(String::new()),\n               ),\n           }))\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n   - The `from_previous_context` method constructs an `AddPublicKeyActionContext` from a `NewAccountContext` and a `scope`.\n   - It initializes `account_properties`, which holds the new account ID, initial balance, and the public key (converted from `scope`).\n   - It returns an instance of `AddPublicKeyActionContext`, encapsulating the account properties and a callback function that is executed before sending a transaction.\n\n5. **Conversion Implementation**:\n   ```rust\n   impl From<AddPublicKeyActionContext> for super::super::AccountPropertiesContext {\n       fn from(item: AddPublicKeyActionContext) -> Self {\n           item.0\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n   - This implementation allows `AddPublicKeyActionContext` to be converted into `AccountPropertiesContext`. This can be useful for passing context between different parts of the application without needing to explicitly access the internal structure.\n\n### Summary\nThe provided code defines a context for adding a public key to a new account in the NEAR Protocol. It utilizes Rust's powerful type system and the `interactive_clap` library to facilitate interactive command-line input. The use of context structs allows for organized management of related data, ensuring that necessary information flows smoothly through the application. \n\nThis structure not only enhances modularity but also improves the overall maintainability of the code, making it easier to handle user input and account management."}]}

Below is a detailed breakdown and explanation of the code's functionality and purpose.\n\n### Breakdown of the Code Snippet\n\n1. **Extracting Values from the Queue**:\n   ```rust\n   epsilon,\n   entropy,\n   ..\n   } = queue.front().unwrap();\n   ```\n   - This line destructures the front message of the `queue`. It retrieves values like `epsilon` and `entropy`, which seem to be parameters associated with the signature generation process. The `..` pattern indicates that other fields are ignored.\n\n2. **Validating the Message Queue**:\n   ```rust\n   if !queue\n       .iter()\n       .all(|msg| presignature_id == &msg.presignature_id)\n   {\n       // Clear the queue if presignature_id does not match for all messages\n       queue.clear();\n       continue;\n   }\n   ```\n   - This block checks if all messages in the queue share the same `presignature_id`. If any message does not match, it clears the queue, suggesting that the messages are considered invalid when they don't align with a common identifier. This ensures consistency in the messages being processed.\n\n3. **Protocol Generation**:\n   ```rust\n   let protocol = match signature_manager.get_or_generate(\n       participants,\n       *receipt_id,\n       *proposer,\n       *presignature_id,\n       request,\n       *epsilon,\n       *entropy,\n       &mut presignature_manager,\n       protocol_cfg,\n   ) {\n       Ok(protocol) => protocol,\n       ...\n   };\n   ```\n   - This part attempts to obtain or generate a signature `protocol` using the `signature_manager`. It passes several parameters including participants, receipt ID, proposer, and others. The match block handles various outcomes, including successful generation and different error cases.\n\n4. **Error Handling**:\n   - The various `Err` cases handle specific failures:\n     - **Presignature is currently being generated**: The code continues to the next iteration.\n     - **Already generated or garbage collected**: Cleans the queue and logs an error.\n     - **Initialization errors**: Warns about bad parameters and clears the queue.\n     - **Unexpected errors**: Logs a general warning and clears the queue.\n\n5. **Processing Messages**:\n   ```rust\n   while let Some(message) = queue.pop_front() {\n       protocol.message(message.from, message.data);\n   }\n   ```\n   - After successfully obtaining a `protocol`, this loop processes each message in the queue by calling a method on the `protocol` with the message's sender and data.\n\n6. **Garbage Collection**:\n   ```rust\n   triple_manager.garbage_collect(protocol_cfg);\n   presignature_manager.garbage_collect(protocol_cfg);\n   signature_manager.garbage_collect(protocol_cfg);\n   ```\n   - At the end of the process, the code performs garbage collection on various managers, cleaning up any resources or states that are no longer needed.\n\n### Message Handling Implementation\n\nThe struct `SignedMessage<T>` is designed for encapsulating messages that can be signed and encrypted. It includes:\n- The actual message `msg` of type `T`.\n- A `sig` field for storing the message's signature.\n- A `from` field indicating the participant who sent the message.\n\nThe `encrypt` method illustrates how to sign and then encrypt a message, ensuring both authenticity and confidentiality.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis code snippet is part of a larger system that handles cryptographic signatures within a protocol, ensuring that the messages being processed are valid and correspond to the expected identifiers. It employs error handling to maintain the integrity of the signature generation process, and it incorporates mechanisms to clean up resources that are no longer necessary. Understanding this snippet is crucial for developers working with NEAR's blockchain technology, particularly in contexts where secure multi-party interactions are required."}]}

Sign transaction\n\n    _near CLI_ offers several ways to sign the created transaction. Let's take a closer look at each.\n\n    - _sign-with-keychain - Sign the transaction with a key saved in the secure keychain_\n\n        _near CLI_ stores and retrieves passwords in a secure OS storage. There _near CLI_ will independently find the access keys and sign the created transaction.\n\n    - _sign-with-legacy-keychain - Sign the transaction with a key saved in legacy keychain (compatible with the old near CLI)_\n\n        _near CLI_ will independently find access keys and sign the created transaction.\n        Directory with access keys defined in [config](#config---manage-connections-in-a-configuration-file).\n        The access keys must be in the _public-key.json_ file located in _/Users/user/.near-credentials/network-name/user-name/_\n        For example, _/Users/frovolod/.near-credentials/testnet/volodymyr.testnet/ed25519_8h7kFK4quSUJRkUwo3LLiK83sraEm2jnQTECuZhWu8HC.json_\n\n        <details><summary><i>Demonstration of the command in interactive mode</i></summary>\n        <a href=\"https://asciinema.org/a/30jHxm9lRevRG4K1h0GWlEciV?autoplay=1&t=1&speed=2\">\n            <img src=\"https://asciinema.org/a/30jHxm9lRevRG4K1h0GWlEciV.png\" width=\"836\"/>\n        </a>\n        </details>\n\n    - _sign-with-ledger - Sign the transaction with Ledger Nano device_\n\n        This option involves signing the created transaction using a ledger.\n\n    - _sign-with-plaintext-private-key - Sign the transaction with a plaintext private key_\n\n        When choosing this signature option, _near CLI_ will ask the user to enter access keys:\n        - \"public_key\":\"ed25519:Ebx7...\",\n        - \"private_key\":\"ed25519:2qM8...\"\n\n    - _sign-with-access-key-file - Sign the transaction using the account access key file (access-key-file.json)_\n\n        When choosing this signature option, _near CLI_ will ask the user to enter the path to a file that contains information about account access keys.\n\n    - _sign-with-seed-phrase - Sign the transaction using the seed phrase_\n\n        When choosing this signature option, _near CLI_ will ask the user to enter the mnemonic phrase associated with the account.\n\n    - _sign-later - Prepare unsigned transaction (we'll use base64 encoding to simplify copy-pasting)_\n\n        This option involves signing the created transaction [later](#sign-transaction---sign-previously-prepared-unsigned-transaction).\n\n2. Actions with a signed transaction\n\n   _near CLI_ support for meta transactions as specified in [NEP-366](https://near.github.io/nearcore/architecture/how/meta-tx.html#meta-transactions). To create it, you just need to specify a _network_ that supports meta transactions. You can find out about such support in [config](#show-connections---Show-a-list-of-network-connections). The *meta_transaction_relayer_url```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This code snippet appears to reflect output from a NEAR Protocol command-line interface (CLI) operation, specifically related to a transaction where one user, `fro_volod.testnet`, has successfully transferred 0.1 NEAR to another user, `volodymyr.testnet`. Below is a detailed breakdown of the key elements of the output and the associated commands mentioned.\n\n### Breakdown of the Output\n\n1. **Transaction Confirmation**:\n   - The line `<fro_volod.testnet> has transferred 0.1 NEAR to <volodymyr.testnet> successfully.` indicates that the transaction was executed successfully, transferring the specified amount of NEAR from one account to another.\n\n2. **Gas and Fees**:\n   - **Gas burned**: The transaction consumed 0.447 Tgas (teragas), which is a measure of the computational resources used.\n   - **Transaction fee**: The fee for this transaction was approximately 0.0000446365125 NEAR, which translates to about $0.00025308 USD at an exchange rate of $5.67 USD/NEAR. This fee structure incentivizes validators to include the transaction in a block.\n\n3. **Transaction ID**:\n   - The transaction ID `F3eZmhtFekCrzKMbc3uk5UbKkMsuuecj6WbK9spcz8bW` is a unique identifier for this specific transaction, which can be used to track it on the NEAR blockchain.\n\n4. **Transaction Explorer Link**:\n   - A URL is provided for users to view the transaction in the NEAR testnet explorer, which allows them to see more details about the transaction on the blockchain.\n\n### Console Command for Transaction\n\nThe console command is provided for users who wish to script the transaction or rerun it easily:\n```bash\n./target/debug/near --teach-me tokens fro_volod.testnet send-near volodymyr.testnet '0.1 NEAR' network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send\n```\n\n- **Command Breakdown**:\n  - `./target/debug/near`: Executes the NEAR CLI from its debug build.\n  - `--teach-me tokens`: This may refer to a mode where the CLI provides instructional output on how to use tokens.\n  - `fro_volod.testnet send-near volodymyr.testnet '0.1 NEAR'`: Specifies the sender account, the action (sending NEAR), the recipient account, and the amount.\n  - `network-config testnet`: Indicates the network configuration to be used, in this case, the NEAR testnet.\n  - `sign-with-keychain`: This specifies the method of signing the transaction, utilizing the secure keychain for storing credentials.\n  - `send`: This final command tells the CLI to execute the transaction.\n\n### Common Points Regarding Transaction Signing\n\n1. **Signing Transactions**:\n   - The NEAR CLI provides multiple methods for signing transactions to enhance security and usability. Users can choose based on their preferences and setups, such as using a hardware wallet (Ledger), plaintext keys, or a keychain.\n\n2. **Meta Transactions**:\n   - The CLI supports meta transactions as per NEP-366, which allow users to create transactions that can be relayed by a third party. This is useful for enhancing user experience by abstracting some complexities of blockchain interactions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis output and command illustrate a successful NEAR Protocol transaction and provide insight into the transaction's operational details, such as fees and signing methods. Understanding each component of the CLI output and the associated commands is crucial for developers and users interacting with the NEAR blockchain. This level of detail ensures transparency and aids in troubleshooting or analyzing transactions on the network."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain the following code snippet from NEAR repository file `README.md`:\n``` `NEAR_SANDBOX_BIN_PATH`: Set this to our own prebuilt `neard-sandbox` bin path if we want to use a non-default version of the sandbox or configure nearcore with our own custom features that we want to test in near-workspaces.\n- `NEAR_SANDBOX_MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE`: Sets the max payload size for sending transaction commits to sandbox. The default is 1gb and is necessary for patching large states.\n- `NEAR_SANDBOX_MAX_FILES`: Set the max amount of files that can be opened at a time in the sandbox. If none is specified, the default size of 4096 will be used. The actual near chain will use over 10,000 in practice, but for testing this should be much lower since we do not have a constantly running blockchain unless our tests take up that much time.\n- `NEAR_RPC_API_KEY`: This is the API key necessary for communicating with RPC nodes. This is useful when interacting with services such as Pagoda Console or a service that can access RPC metrics. This is not a **hard** requirement, but it is recommended to running the Pagoda example in the examples folder.\n- `NEAR_ENABLE_SANDBOX_LOG`: Set this to `1` to enable sandbox logging.

Below is a detailed explanation of each configuration variable:\n\n### Configuration Variables Explained\n\n1. **`NEAR_SANDBOX_BIN_PATH`**:\n   - **Purpose**: This environment variable allows you to specify the path to your own prebuilt `neard-sandbox` binary.\n   - **Use Case**: If you want to use a version of the NEAR sandbox that is different from the default one, or if you have customized the NEAR core with specific features that you would like to test in your NEAR workspaces, you can set this variable to point to that binary.\n\n2. **`NEAR_SANDBOX_MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE`**:\n   - **Purpose**: This variable defines the maximum payload size for sending transaction commits to the sandbox.\n   - **Default Value**: The default size is 1 GB.\n   - **Importance**: This setting is particularly crucial when dealing with large states, as it allows the sandbox to handle larger transaction payloads without failing.\n\n3. **`NEAR_SANDBOX_MAX_FILES`**:\n   - **Purpose**: This variable sets the maximum number of files that can be opened simultaneously in the sandbox.\n   - **Default Value**: If not specified, the default is 4096.\n   - **Context**: While the actual NEAR blockchain may handle over 10,000 files in practice, for testing purposes, this value is kept lower to optimize resource usage. This is especially relevant since the sandbox does not operate like a constantly running blockchain unless tests require extensive time.\n\n4. **`NEAR_RPC_API_KEY`**:\n   - **Purpose**: This variable is used to provide an API key for communicating with RPC nodes.\n   - **Use Case**: It is particularly useful when interacting with services such as the Pagoda Console or any service that can access RPC metrics. \n   - **Recommendation**: While it is not mandatory, it is advisable to set this variable when running examples provided in the Pagoda folder to ensure proper communication with the NEAR network.\n\n5. **`NEAR_ENABLE_SANDBOX_LOG`**:\n   - **Purpose**: This variable controls the logging feature of the sandbox.\n   - **Usage**: By setting this variable to `1`, sandbox logging is enabled.\n   - **Benefit**: This is beneficial for debugging issues related to the `neard-sandbox` binary, as it provides additional output that can help diagnose problems that occur during testing.\n\n### Summary\nThese environment variables are essential for developers working with the NEAR Protocol to tailor the sandbox environment according to their testing needs and to ensure smooth interactions with the NEAR blockchain. By configuring these properties, developers can optimize their development workflows and troubleshoot issues effectively."}]}

Let's break down the provided Rust code snippet from the NEAR Protocol repository, specifically from the file `examples/mission-control/src/rate.rs`.\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n1. **Imports**:\n   ```rust\n   use crate::account::*;\n   use crate::asset::*;\n   use std::collections::HashMap;\n   use near_sdk::near;\n   ```\n   - `use crate::account::*;`: This imports all items (functions, structs, enums, etc.) from the `account` module in the same crate. This is likely related to user accounts or balances.\n   - `use crate::asset::*;`: Similarly, this imports all items from the `asset` module, which likely deals with different types of assets.\n   - `use std::collections::HashMap;`: This imports the `HashMap` collection from the standard library, which is a data structure used to store key-value pairs.\n   - `use near_sdk::near;`: This imports the `near` module from the NEAR SDK, which provides various utilities and macros for building smart contracts on the NEAR platform.\n\n2. **Struct Definition**:\n   ```rust\n   #[derive(PartialEq, Eq)]\n   #[near(serializers = [json, borsh])]\n   pub struct Rate {\n       pub credit: HashMap<Asset, Quantity>,\n       pub debit: HashMap<Asset, Quantity>,\n   }\n   ```\n   - `#[derive(PartialEq, Eq)]`: This automatically implements the `PartialEq` and `Eq` traits for the `Rate` struct. This means instances of `Rate` can be compared for equality and used in collections that require equality checks, such as `HashMap`.\n   - `#[near(serializers = [json, borsh])]`: This attribute specifies how instances of `Rate` should be serialized and deserialized. In this case, it indicates that both JSON and Borsh serialization formats are supported. Borsh is a binary serialization format used by NEAR for efficient data storage and transfer.\n   - `pub struct Rate`: This declares a public struct named `Rate`, which means it can be accessed from outside the module.\n   - Within the `Rate` struct, there are two fields:\n     - `pub credit: HashMap<Asset, Quantity>`: This field is a public `HashMap` where the keys are of type `Asset` and the values are of type `Quantity`. This likely represents a mapping of assets to their credit amounts.\n     - `pub debit: HashMap<Asset, Quantity>`: Similarly, this field is another public `HashMap` for debits, representing assets and their corresponding debit amounts.\n\n3. **Implementation Block**:\n   ```rust\n   impl Rate {}\n   ```\n   - This empty `impl Rate {}` block is where you would typically implement methods associated with the `Rate` struct. Currently, it does not define any methods, but it sets up the structure for future enhancements or functionalities that may be added.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe provided code snippet defines a `Rate` struct that is designed to hold information about credit and debit amounts for different assets. It uses `HashMap` to map each asset to its corresponding quantity for both credit and debit transactions.

It includes several helper functions designed to assist with creating, handling, and managing contract interactions. Let's break down each function and its purpose:\n\n### 1. `collectArguments`\nThis function collects arguments from a class instance and prepares them for use in contract methods.\n\n```typescript\nfunction collectArguments(classId: t.Identifier): t.VariableDeclaration {\n  return t.variableDeclaration(\"const\", [\n    t.variableDeclarator(\n      t.identifier(\"_args\"),\n      t.callExpression(\n        t.memberExpression(classId, t.identifier(\"_getArgs\")),\n        []\n      )\n    ),\n  ]);\n}\n```\n- **Purpose**: It creates a variable `_args` that holds the result of calling the `_getArgs` method on the provided class identifier (`classId`). This is typically used to gather arguments that will be passed to contract methods.\n\n### 2. `callContractMethod`\nThis function constructs a call expression for invoking a contract method.\n\n```typescript\nfunction callContractMethod(methodName: string): t.VariableDeclaration {\n  return t.variableDeclaration(\"const\", [\n    t.variableDeclarator(\n      t.identifier(\"_result\"),\n      t.callExpression(\n        t.memberExpression(t.identifier(\"_contract\"), t.identifier(methodName)),\n        [t.identifier(\"_args\")]\n      )\n    ),\n  ]);\n}\n```\n- **Purpose**: It declares a constant `_result` which stores the outcome of calling a method on the `_contract` object using the previously collected `_args` as arguments. This is a critical step in executing a contract's function.\n\n### 3. `saveToStorage`\nThis function handles saving the contract state to storage when certain methods are called.\n\n```typescript\nfunction saveToStorage(\n  classId: t.Identifier,\n  methodType: string\n): t.EmptyStatement | t.ExpressionStatement {\n  if (![\"initialize\", \"call\", \"migrate\"].includes(methodType)) {\n    return t.emptyStatement();\n  }\n\n  return t.expressionStatement(\n    t.callExpression(\n      t.memberExpression(classId, t.identifier(\"_saveToStorage\")),\n      [t.identifier(\"_contract\")]\n    )\n  );\n}\n```\n- **Purpose**: It checks if the `methodType` is one of the specified types (`initialize`, `call`, or `migrate`). If true, it generates an expression statement that calls the `_saveToStorage` method on the `classId` with `_contract` as an argument, which is essential for persisting the contract's state after certain operations.\n\n### 4. `executePromise`\nThis function handles the execution of promises returned by contract methods.\n\n```typescript\nfunction executePromise(classId: t.Identifier): t.IfStatement {\n  return t.ifStatement(\n    t.binaryExpression(\n      \"!==\",\n      t.identifier(\"_result\"),\n      t.identifier(\"undefined\")\n    ),\n    t.ifStatement(\n      t.logicalExpression(\n        \"&&\",\n        t.logicalExpression(\n          \"&&\",\n          t.identifier(\"_result\"),\n          t.memberExpression(\n            t.identifier(\"_result\"),\n            t.identifier(\"constructor\")\n          )\n        ),\n        t.binaryExpression(\n          \"===\",\n          t.memberExpression(\n            t.memberExpression(\n              t.identifier(\"_result\"),\n              t.identifier(\"constructor\")\n            ),\n            t.identifier(\"name\")\n          ),\n          t.stringLiteral(\"NearPromise\")\n        )\n      ),\n      t.expressionStatement(\n        t.callExpression(\n          t.memberExpression(t.identifier(\"_result\"), t.identifier(\"onReturn\")),\n          []\n        )\n      ),\n      t.expressionStatement(\n        t.callExpression(\n          t.memberExpression(t.identifier(\"env\"), t.identifier(\"value_return\")),\n          [\n            t.callExpression(\n              t.memberExpression(classId, t.identifier(\"_serialize\")),\n              [t.identifier(\"_result\"), t.booleanLiteral(true)]\n            ),\n          ]\n        )\n      )\n    )\n  );\n}\n```\n- **Purpose**: This function checks if `_result` is defined and if it is an instance of `NearPromise`. If it is, it calls the `onReturn` method of the promise. Otherwise, it returns the serialized value back to the caller using `env.value_return`. This is important for handling asynchronous execution and returning results correctly.\n\n### 5. `createDeclaration`\nThis function constructs the overall function declaration for a contract method.\n\n```typescript\nfunction createDeclaration(\n  classId: t.Identifier,\n  methodName: string,\n  methodType: string\n): t.ExportNamedDeclaration {\n  return t.exportNamedDeclaration(\n    t.functionDeclaration(\n      t.identifier(methodName),\n      [],\n      t.blockStatement([\n        // Read the state of the contract from storage.\n        readState(classId, methodType),\n        // Throw if initialized on any subsequent init function calls.\n        preventDoubleInit(methodType),\n        // Throw if NOT initialized on any non init function calls.\n        ensureInitBeforeCall(classId, methodType),\n        // Create instance of contract by calling _create function.\n        // let _contract = Contract._...\n      ])\n    )\n  );\n}\n```\n- **Purpose**: This function builds a named export for a function that corresponds to a contract method. It includes various checks and state read operations to ensure that the contract is in the correct state before executing the method. This helps enforce rules around contract initialization and state management.\n\n### Summary\nOverall, the code snippet is part of a toolchain that facilitates the development of smart contracts on the NEAR Protocol. It provides utility functions for managing arguments, calling contract methods, handling storage, and managing promises, which are essential for contract functionality and state management. Each function plays a specific role in ensuring that contract interactions are correctly handled and that the contract's state is properly maintained."}]}

Here's a detailed breakdown of the key components of this snippet:\n\n### Overview\n\nThe snippet outlines the process of creating a transaction, requesting a signature, and reconstructing that signature for two different blockchains: Ethereum and Bitcoin. Each section provides insights into how transactions are handled in these ecosystems while leveraging NEAR's capabilities.\n\n### Address Generation\n\n```plaintext\n- `example.near` + `ethereum-1` = `0x1b48b83a308ea4beb845db088180dc3389f8aa3b`\n- `example.near` + `ethereum-2` = `0x99c5d3025dc736541f2d97c3ef3c90de4d221315`\n```\n- **Purpose**: This part illustrates how a unique address is generated for the provided NEAR account (e.g., `example.near`) combined with different blockchain identifiers (like `ethereum-1` and `ethereum-2`). This ensures that the same NEAR account can interact with multiple blockchains without address conflicts.\n\n### Creating the Transaction\n\n```markdown\n## 2. Creating the Transaction\n```\n- **Description**: This section discusses constructing the transaction that will be signed. The specifics depend on the target blockchain, but generally, it involves hashing the message or transaction.\n\n```markdown\n<Tabs groupId=\"code-tabs\">\n  <TabItem value=\"Ξ Ethereum\">\n    <Github language=\"js\"\n      url=\"https://github.com/near-examples/near-multichain/blob/main/src/services/ethereum.js\"\n      start=\"46\" end=\"73\" />\n    \nIn Ethereum, constructing the transaction is simple since you only need to specify the address of the receiver and how much you want to send.\n</TabItem>\n\n<TabItem value=\"₿ Bitcoin\">\n    <Github language=\"js\"\n      url=\"https://github.com/near-examples/near-multichain/blob/main/src/services/bitcoin.js\"\n      start=\"27\" end=\"81\" />\n    \nIn bitcoin, you construct a new transaction by using all the Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) of the account as input, and then specify the output address and amount you want to send.\n</TabItem>\n</Tabs>\n```\n- **Ethereum**: The transaction is straightforward, requiring just the recipient's address and the amount to send.\n- **Bitcoin**: Transaction construction is more complex, as it involves using UTXOs as inputs, which must be specified along with the output address and amount.\n\n### Requesting the Signature\n\n```markdown\n## 3. Requesting the Signature\n```\n- **Explanation**: After constructing the transaction, a signature request is made to the MPC smart contract.\n\n```markdown\nThe method requires two parameters:\n1. The `transaction` to be signed for the target blockchain\n2. The derivation `path` for the account we want to use to sign the transaction\n```\n- **Signature Request**: The signature request requires the transaction details and the derivation path, which specifies how to access the private key for signing.\n\n### Reconstructing the Signature\n\n```markdown\n## 4. Reconstructing the Signature\n```\n- **Signature Reconstruction**: The MPC contract returns the components necessary to reconstruct the signature instead of the signature itself.\n\n```markdown\nIn Ethereum, the signature is reconstructed by concatenating the `r`, `s`, and `v` values returned by the contract.\nIn Bitcoin, the signature is reconstructed by concatenating the `r` and `s` values returned by the contract.\n```\n- **Ethereum**: The signature comprises three values (`r`, `s`, `v`).\n- **Bitcoin**: The signature consists of two values (`r`, `s`).\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n```markdown\n<details> \n  <summary> Deposit amount </summary>\n```\n- **Deposit**: A deposit is required for the signature request, which can vary based on network conditions. Unused deposits will be refunded, and there are mechanisms to check required deposits, though they may not be reliable due to potential changes in network fees.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis code snippet from the NEAR documentation provides a comprehensive guide for developers on how to create, sign, and reconstruct transactions across different blockchains using NEAR's infrastructure and an MPC service. It highlights differences in transaction construction and signature processes between Ethereum and Bitcoin, which is crucial for cross-chain functionality."}]}

Given the complexity and number of participants involved across the ecosystem, a well-defined process helps ensure transparency, security, and stability.\n\n## NEP Types\n\nThere are four kinds of NEPs:\n\n1. A **Protocol** NEP describes a new feature of the NEAR protocol.\n2. A **Contract Standards** NEP specifies NEAR Smart Contract interfaces for a reusable concept in the NEAR ecosystem.\n3. A **Wallet Standards** NEP specifies ecosystem-wide APIs for Wallet implementations.\n4. A **Developer Tools** NEP defines norms and guidelines for developer tooling in the NEAR ecosystem.\n\nCurrently, all types of NEPs follow the same process, but for Protocol NEPs a draft implementation is required.\n\n## Submit a NEP\n\n### Start with ideation\n\nEveryone in the community is welcome to propose, discuss, and review ideas to improve the NEAR protocol and standards. The NEP process begins with a [new idea](https://www.neardevgov.org/blog/how-to-ideate-in-the-near-developer-governance) for the NEAR ecosystem. A single NEP should contain a single key proposal or new idea.\n\nEach NEP must have an author: Someone who writes the NEP using the style and format described below. The author, or another champion, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate forums and attempts to build community consensus around the idea to help it progress toward completion.\n\nBefore submitting a NEP, the author should first attempt to ascertain whether the idea is NEP-able. Vetting an idea publicly before writing a NEP saves the potential author time. Asking the NEAR community first if the idea is original helps prevent effort on something guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions. It also helps ensure the idea applies to the entire community. Just because an idea sounds good to the author does not mean it will work for most people in most use cases.\n\nIn general, the process for socializing an idea is:\n\n- **Check prior proposals:** Many ideas for changing NEAR come up frequently. Please search the [Dev Gov Gigs Board](https://devgovgigs.near.social), the [NEAR Forums](https://gov.near.org), and NEPs in this repo before proposing something new.\n- **Share the idea:** Submit your [idea](https://www.neardevgov.org/blog/how-to-ideate-in-the-near-developer-governance) on the [Dev Gov Gigs Board](https://devgovgigs.near.social).\n- **Get feedback:** The [Dev Gov Gigs Board](https://devgovgigs.near.social) has comment threading which allows the community to ideate, ask questions, wrestle with approaches, etc. If more immediate responses are desired, consider bringing the conversation to the appropriate [Community Group](https://gov.near.org/c/dev/community-groups/103).\n\n### Submit a NEP Draft\n\nFollowing the above initial discussions, the author should submit a NEP draft into the GitHub NEP repository. The draft NEP must follow the [NEP-0000 template](https://github.com/near/NEPs/blob/master/nep-0000-template.md), or else it will fail the review immediately.\n\nTo submit a NEP draft as a pull request, the NEP author should:\n\n1. Fork the [NEPs repository](https://github.com/near/NEPs).\n2.

Let's break down the provided Rust code snippet from the NEAR Protocol repository, specifically from the `sign_with_keychain` module. This code is part of the functionality related to signing transactions using a keychain, and it contains several important components.\n\n### Code Explanation\n\n1. **Returning a Result from a Function:**\n   ```rust\n   Ok(\n       super::sign_with_legacy_keychain::SignLegacyKeychainContext::from_previous_context(\n           previous_context,\n           &legacy_scope,\n       )?\n       .into(),\n   )\n   ```\n   This part of the code is returning a result (of type `Result`) from a function. It uses the `?` operator, which will automatically return an error if `from_previous_context` fails. The method `from_previous_context` appears to create a new signing context based on an existing context (`previous_context`) alongside a legacy scope (`legacy_scope`). The result is then converted into another type via `into()`.\n\n2. **Implementing `From` Trait:**\n   ```rust\n   impl From<SignKeychainContext> for super::SubmitContext {\n       fn from(item: SignKeychainContext) -> Self {\n           Self {\n               network_config: item.network_config,\n               global_context: item.global_context,\n               signed_transaction_or_signed_delegate_action: item\n                   .signed_transaction_or_signed_delegate_action,\n               on_before_sending_transaction_callback: item.on_before_sending_transaction_callback,\n               on_after_sending_transaction_callback: item.on_after_sending_transaction_callback,\n           }\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n   This `impl` block defines how to convert an instance of `SignKeychainContext` into an instance of `SubmitContext`. It maps the fields from `SignKeychainContext` directly to the corresponding fields in `SubmitContext`. This conversion is useful for integrating different parts of the signing process with transaction submission.\n\n3. **Input Functions:**\n   The following functions are designed to prompt the user for input when the application is in offline mode. They return a `Result` containing an `Option` of the requested type, which can be `Some(value)` or `None`.\n\n   - **Input Signer Public Key:**\n     ```rust\n     fn input_signer_public_key(\n         context: &crate::commands::TransactionContext,\n     ) -> color_eyre::eyre::Result<Option<crate::types::public_key::PublicKey>> {\n         if context.global_context.offline {\n             return Ok(Some(\n                 CustomType::<crate::types::public_key::PublicKey>::new(\"Enter public_key:\")\n                     .prompt()?,\n             ));\n         }\n         Ok(None)\n     }\n     ```\n     This function checks if the context is in offline mode. If true, it prompts the user to input a public key and returns it wrapped in `Some`. If not in offline mode, it returns `None`.\n\n   - **Input Nonce:**\n     ```rust\n     fn input_nonce(\n         context: &crate::commands::TransactionContext,\n     ) -> color_eyre::eyre::Result<Option<u64>> {\n         if context.global_context.offline {\n             return Ok(Some(\n                 CustomType::<u64>::new(\"Enter a nonce for the access key:\").prompt()?,\n             ));\n         }\n         Ok(None)\n     }\n     ```\n     Similar to the previous function, this one prompts for a nonce value.\n\n   - **Input Block Hash:**\n     ```rust\n     fn input_block_hash(\n         context: &crate::commands::TransactionContext,\n     ) -> color_eyre::eyre::Result<Option<crate::types::crypto_hash::CryptoHash>> {\n         if context.global_context.offline {\n             return Ok(Some(\n                 CustomType::<crate::types::crypto_hash::CryptoHash>::new(\n                     \"Enter recent block hash:\",\n                 )\n                 .prompt()?,\n             ));\n         }\n         Ok(None)\n     }\n     ```\n     Prompts the user to enter a recent block hash if in offline mode.\n\n   - **Input Block Height:**\n     ```rust\n     fn input_block_height(\n         context: &crate::commands::TransactionContext,\n     ) -> color_eyre::eyre::Result<Option<near_primitives::types::BlockHeight>> {\n         if context.global_context.offline {\n             return Ok(Some(\n                 CustomType::<near_primitives::types::BlockHeight>::new(\n                     \"Enter recent block height:\",\n                 )\n                 .prompt()?,\n             ));\n         }\n         Ok(None)\n     }\n     ```\n     This function prompts for the block height, following the same pattern as the previous functions.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis code snippet is part of a larger module responsible for handling transaction signing within the NEAR Protocol. It includes functions for gathering necessary inputs from users in offline mode and a conversion implementation that allows seamless transition between different context types during the signing process. The use of the `color_eyre` crate indicates that this code handles errors gracefully, providing enhanced user feedback in case of issues. The `CustomType::prompt()` method likely handles user interaction via command line, making it user-friendly for those operating in an offline environment."}]}

It is common in web development, especially in libraries and frameworks, to use encoded images to prevent multiple HTTP requests for assets like icons.\n\n### Breakdown of the Snippet\n\n1. **Base64 Encoding**: \n   The string is encoded in Base64, which is a method for converting binary data (like images) into an ASCII string format. This encoding allows binary data to be easily transmitted over text-based protocols such as HTTP.\n\n2. **Purpose**:\n   This encoded string is typically used in the following contexts:\n   - **Inline Images**: Instead of linking to an external image file, the image data is embedded directly in the HTML or CSS, reducing the number of HTTP requests and improving load times.\n   - **Icons**: In this case, the string is likely representing an icon that will be displayed in the NEAR wallet UI.\n\n3. **Decoding**:\n   To utilize this encoded string in a web application, you would typically decode it back into binary data to create an image. This can be done in JavaScript as follows:\n\n   ```javascript\n   const encodedIcon = `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`;\n   \n   // Create an image element\n   const img = new Image();\n   img.src = `data:image/png;base64,${encodedIcon}`; // Assuming the icon is a PNG image\n   document.body.appendChild(img); // Append the image to the document body\n   ```\n\n### Conclusion\nThis encoded string is a compact representation of an image that can be decoded and used in web applications directly, making it easier to manage assets without relying on separate file hosting.

This module is responsible for establishing a connection to the NEAR blockchain using a configuration object. Below is a detailed explanation of the code, its components, and its functionality.\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n#### Documentation Header\n\nThe header comment provides a detailed overview of the `connect` function including:\n\n- **Purpose**: It indicates that the function connects to the NEAR blockchain using the specified configuration.\n- **Configuration Requirements**: \n  - `networkId`: The ID of the NEAR network (e.g., `testnet`).\n  - `nodeUrl`: The URL of the NEAR RPC node.\n- **Optional Parameters**: \n  - `keyStore`: For signing transactions.\n  - `keyPath`: File path for an account key.\n  - `deps.keyStore`: A deprecated option for legacy applications.\n- **Prioritization**: It specifies the order of priority if multiple key stores are provided.\n\n#### Imports\n\nThe module imports various utilities and types:\n- `readKeyFile` from `key_stores/unencrypted_file_system_keystore`: A function to read keys from a file.\n- `InMemoryKeyStore` and `MergeKeyStore`: Classes for handling key storage.\n- `Near` and `NearConfig`: Main classes for interacting with the NEAR blockchain.\n- `Logger`: A utility for logging information.\n\n#### ConnectConfig Interface\n\nThis interface extends `NearConfig` and adds an optional property `keyPath`, which indicates the location of a key file. \n\n```typescript\nexport interface ConnectConfig extends NearConfig {\n    keyPath?: string; // Optional path to the key file\n}\n```\n\n#### Connect Function\n\nThe `connect` function initializes the connection to the NEAR network. Here's a step-by-step explanation of its functionality:\n\n1. **Logger Configuration**:\n   - If `logger` is set to `false`, logging is disabled.\n   - If a logger is provided, it overrides the default logger.\n\n   ```typescript\n   if (config.logger === false) {\n       Logger.overrideLogger(undefined);\n   } else if (config.logger !== undefined && config.logger !== null) {\n       Logger.overrideLogger(config.logger);\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Key Loading**:\n   - If a `keyPath` is provided along with a `keyStore` or `deps.keyStore`, it attempts to read the key from the specified file.\n   - If successful, it creates an `InMemoryKeyStore`, sets the key for the specified `networkId`, and merges it with the existing `keyStore` into a `MergeKeyStore`.\n\n   ```typescript\n   if (config.keyPath && (config.keyStore || config.deps?.keyStore)) {\n       try {\n           const accountKeyFile = await readKeyFile(config.keyPath);\n           if (accountKeyFile[0]) {\n               const keyPair = accountKeyFile[1];\n               const keyPathStore = new InMemoryKeyStore();\n               await keyPathStore.setKey(config.networkId, accountKeyFile[0], keyPair);\n               if (!config.masterAccount) {\n                   config.masterAccount = accountKeyFile[0];\n               }\n               config.keyStore = new MergeKeyStore([\n                   keyPathStore,\n                   config.keyStore || config.deps?.keyStore\n               ], { writeKeyStoreIndex: 1 });\n               Logger.log(`Loaded master account ${accountKeyFile[0]} key from ${config.keyPath} with public key = ${keyPair.getPublicKey()}`);\n           }\n       } catch (error) {\n           Logger.warn(`Failed to load master account key from ${config.keyPath}: ${error}`);\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Returning the Near Object**:\n   - Finally, it creates and returns a new `Near` instance using the configuration provided.\n\n   ```typescript\n   return new Near(config);\n   ```\n\n### Example Usage\n\nThe code snippet provides examples of how to use the `connect` function:\n\n1. Basic connection without a key store:\n   ```javascript\n   async function initNear() {\n     const near = await connect({\n        networkId: 'testnet',\n        nodeUrl: 'https://rpc.testnet.near.org'\n     });\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. Connection with a logger disabled:\n   ```javascript\n   async function initNear() {\n     const near = await connect({\n        networkId: 'testnet',\n        nodeUrl: 'https://rpc.testnet.near.org',\n        logger: false\n     });\n   }\n   ```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOverall, the `connect` function is vital for setting up a connection to the NEAR blockchain, allowing developers to interact with the network easily. It handles configurations for logging, key management, and network settings, ensuring a flexible and robust connection setup."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain the following code snippet from NEAR repository file `specs/Standards/StorageManagement.md`:\n``` deposit\n\n#### 1. Account registers with `social`\n\n**High-level explanation**\n\nAlice issues a transaction to deposit Ⓝ for her account. While the `storage_balance_bounds.min` for this contract is 0.00235Ⓝ, the frontend she uses suggests adding 0.1Ⓝ, so that she can immediately start adding data to the app, rather than *only* registering.\n\n**Technical calls**\n\nUsing NEAR CLI:\n\n    near call social storage_deposit '' \\\n      --accountId alice --amount 0.1\n\nThe result:\n\n    {\n      total: '100000000000000000000000',\n      available: '97650000000000000000000'\n    }\n\nHere we see that she has deposited 0.1Ⓝ and that 0.00235 of it has been used to register her account, and is therefore locked by the contract. The rest is available to facilitate interaction with the contract, but could also be withdrawn by Alice by using `storage_withdraw`.\n\n#### 2. Unnecessary attempt to re-register using `registration_only` param\n\n**High-level explanation**\n\nAlice can't remember if she already registered and re-sends the call, using the `registration_only` param to ensure she doesn't attach another 0.1Ⓝ.\n\n**Technical calls**\n\nUsing NEAR CLI:\n\n    near call social storage_deposit '{\"registration_only\": true}' \\\n      --accountId alice --amount 0.1\n\nThe result:\n\n    {\n      total: '100000000000000000000000',\n      available: '97650000000000000000000'\n    }\n\nAdditionally, Alice will be refunded the extra 0.1Ⓝ that she just attached. This makes it easy for other contracts to always attempt to register users while performing batch transactions without worrying about errors or lost deposits.\n\nNote that if Alice had not included `registration_only`, she would have ended up with a `total` of  0.2Ⓝ.\n\n#### 3. Account increases storage deposit\n\nAssumption: `social` has a `post` function which allows creating a new post with free-form text. Alice has used almost all of her available storage balance. She attempts to call `post` with a large amount of text, and the transaction aborts because she needs to pay for more storage first.\n\nNote that applications will probably want to avoid this situation in the first place by prompting users to top up storage deposits sufficiently before available balance runs out.\n\n**High-level explanation**\n\n1. Alice issues a transaction, let's say `social.post`, and it fails with an intelligible error message to tell her that she has an insufficient storage balance to cover the cost of the operation\n2. Alice issues a transaction to increase her storage balance\n3. Alice retries the initial transaction and it succeeds\n\n**Technical calls**\n\n1. This is outside the scope of this spec, but let's say Alice calls `near call social post '{ \"text\": \"very long message\" }'`, and that this fails with a message saying something like \"Insufficient storage deposit for transaction. Please call `storage_deposit` and attach at least 0.1 NEAR, then try again.\"\n\n2. Alice deposits the proper amount in a transaction by calling `social::storage_deposit` with the attached deposit of '0.1'. Using NEAR CLI:\n\n       near call social storage_deposit '' \\\n         --accountId alice --amount 0.1\n\n   The result:\n\n       {\n         total: '200000000000000000000000',\n         available: '100100000000000000000000'\n       }\n\n3. Alice tries the initial `near call social post` call again. It works.\n\n#### 4. Removing storage and reclaiming excess deposit\n\nAssumption: Alice has more deposited than she is using.\n\n**High-level explanation**\n\n1. Alice views her storage balance and sees that she has extra.\n2. Alice withdraws her excess deposit.\n\n**Technical calls**\n\n1. Alice queries `social::storage_balance_of({ \"account_id\": \"alice\" })`. With NEAR CLI:\n\n       near view social storage_balance_of '{\"account_id\": \"alice\"}'\n\n   Response:\n\n       {\n         total: '200000000000000000000000',\n         available: '100100000000000000000000'\n       }\n\n2. Alice calls `storage_withdraw` with a 1 yoctoⓃ deposit. NEAR CLI command:\n\n       near call social storage_withdraw \\\n         '{\"amount\": \"100100000000000000000000\"}' \\\n         --accountId alice --depositYocto 1\n\n   Result:\n\n       {\n         total: '200000000000000000000000',\n         available: '0'\n       }\n\n## Reference-level explanation\n\n**NOTES**:\n\n- All amounts, balances and allowance are limited by `U```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The provided code snippet outlines the process of managing storage deposits on the NEAR Protocol, specifically for a hypothetical social application. Let's break down each part of the snippet to clarify the functionality, interactions, and expected outcomes at a technical level.\n\n### 1. Account Registration with `social`\n\n**High-level Explanation:**\nAlice initiates a transaction to deposit NEAR tokens into her account. The contract specifies a minimum storage balance (`storage_balance_bounds.min`) which is set to 0.00235Ⓝ. However, to facilitate immediate interactions, Alice decides to deposit 0.1Ⓝ.\n\n**Technical Calls:**\nUsing the NEAR CLI, Alice performs the following command:\n\n```bash\nnear call social storage_deposit '' \\\n  --accountId alice --amount 0.1\n```\n\n**Expected Result:**\nThe result indicates that Alice has deposited 0.1Ⓝ. Out of this, 0.00235Ⓝ is locked for storage registration, leaving the available balance for interactions with the contract.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"total\": \"100000000000000000000000\",\n  \"available\": \"97650000000000000000000\"\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Unnecessary Attempt to Re-register Using `registration_only`\n\n**High-level Explanation:**\nIf Alice is unsure whether she has already registered, she can retry the deposit using the `registration_only` parameter. This prevents her from depositing an additional 0.1Ⓝ.\n\n**Technical Calls:**\nAlice issues the following command:\n\n```bash\nnear call social storage_deposit '{\"registration_only\": true}' \\\n  --accountId alice --amount 0.1\n```\n\n**Expected Result:**\nThe result shows that her total balance remains the same, and she is refunded the additional deposit of 0.1Ⓝ, thus avoiding unnecessary double deposits.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"total\": \"100000000000000000000000\",\n  \"available\": \"97650000000000000000000\"\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Account Increases Storage Deposit\n\n**High-level Explanation:**\nAssuming Alice wants to make a post but hits a storage limit, the application should ideally notify her about insufficient storage. She will need to increase her storage balance to proceed.\n\n**Technical Calls:**\n1. Alice attempts to post and receives an error due to insufficient storage.\n2. She deposits more NEAR for storage:\n\n```bash\nnear call social storage_deposit '' \\\n  --accountId alice --amount 0.1\n```\n\n**Expected Result:**\nAfter this transaction, her total storage balance increases:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"total\": \"200000000000000000000000\",\n  \"available\": \"100100000000000000000000\"\n}\n```\n\n3. Alice can now retry her post transaction, which should succeed.\n\n### 4. Removing Storage and Reclaiming Excess Deposit\n\n**High-level Explanation:**\nWhen Alice realizes she has more deposited than necessary, she can withdraw the excess.\n\n**Technical Calls:**\n1. To check her storage balance, she runs:\n\n```bash\nnear view social storage_balance_of '{\"account_id\": \"alice\"}'\n```\n\n**Expected Response:**\nShe sees her current balances:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"total\": \"200000000000000000000000\",\n  \"available\": \"100100000000000000000000\"\n}\n```\n\n2. To withdraw excess funds, she uses:\n\n```bash\nnear call social storage_withdraw \\\n  '{\"amount\": \"100100000000000000000000\"}' \\\n  --accountId alice --depositYocto 1\n```\n\n**Expected Result:**\nAfter the withdrawal, her balance updates to reflect the withdrawn amount:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"total\": \"200000000000000000000000\",\n  \"available\": \"0\"\n}\n```\n\n### Summary\n\nThis snippet illustrates the importance of managing storage deposits within NEAR contracts effectively. It enables users to register, interact, and reclaim their deposits while avoiding unnecessary fees and complications. By using well-defined APIs, users can seamlessly handle their storage needs, ensuring a smooth experience when interacting with dApps on the NEAR Protocol. \n\nUnderstanding this flow is essential for developers building on NEAR, as it directly influences the usability and efficiency of decentralized applications."}]}

This trait outlines essential functionalities required for a fungible token standard, which is part of the NEAR Contract Standards. Below is a detailed breakdown of the components and functionality described in the code snippet.\n\n### Key Components\n\n1. **Imports:**\n   ```rust\n   use near_sdk::ext_contract;\n   use near_sdk::json_types::U128;\n   use near_sdk::AccountId;\n   use near_sdk::PromiseOrValue;\n   ```\n   - These imports bring in necessary types and traits from the `near_sdk` library:\n     - `ext_contract`: Used for defining external contracts.\n     - `U128`: A wrapper for 128-bit unsigned integers, commonly used for token amounts.\n     - `AccountId`: Represents account identifiers in the NEAR blockchain.\n     - `PromiseOrValue`: Used to handle asynchronous results that can either be a promise or a direct value.\n\n2. **Trait Definition:**\n   ```rust\n   #[ext_contract(ext_ft_core)]\n   pub trait FungibleTokenCore {\n   ```\n   - `FungibleTokenCore` is defined as an external contract trait. This means that other contracts can interact with it, following the defined methods.\n\n3. **Method Descriptions:**\n   - The trait includes several method signatures that define the core functionalities of a fungible token:\n\n   **`ft_transfer`:**\n   ```rust\n   fn ft_transfer(&mut self, receiver_id: AccountId, amount: U128, memo: Option<String>);\n   ```\n   - **Purpose:** Transfers a specified amount of tokens from the caller's account (the `env::predecessor_account_id`) to the `receiver_id`.\n   - **Parameters:**\n     - `receiver_id`: The account that will receive the tokens.\n     - `amount`: The amount of tokens to be transferred, represented as a `U128`.\n     - `memo`: An optional memo string that can contain additional information about the transfer.\n\n   **`ft_transfer_call`:**\n   ```rust\n   fn ft_transfer_call(\n       &mut self,\n       receiver_id: AccountId,\n       amount: U128,\n       memo: Option<String>,\n       msg: String,\n   ) -> PromiseOrValue<U128>;\n   ```\n   - **Purpose:** Similar to `ft_transfer`, but also calls a method (`ft_on_transfer`) on the receiving contract after transferring the tokens. This allows for further interaction with the receiver contract.\n   - **Parameters:**\n     - `receiver_id`: The account ID of the receiving contract.\n     - `amount`: The amount of tokens to transfer.\n     - `memo`: An optional memo.\n     - `msg`: A string that can be passed to the receiver contract.\n   - **Return Value:** A `PromiseOrValue<U128>` that indicates the result of the transfer, which can be either a promise or a direct value.\n\n   **`ft_total_supply`:**\n   ```rust\n   fn ft_total_supply(&self) -> U128;\n   ```\n   - **Purpose:** Returns the total supply of tokens in circulation.\n\n   **`ft_balance_of`:**\n   ```rust\n   fn ft_balance_of(&self, account_id: AccountId) -> U128;\n   ```\n   - **Purpose:** Returns the balance of tokens for a specified account.\n\n### Security Considerations:\nThe comments throughout the code emphasize the importance of security, particularly regarding:\n- The requirement for both accounts involved in a transfer to be registered with the contract.\n- Handling attached deposits appropriately, specifically requiring exactly 1 yoctoNEAR to be attached to the calls.\n- Ensuring that the `ft_on_transfer` method in the receiving contract behaves correctly to avoid loss of tokens.\n\n### Example Implementation:\nThe example implementation provided in the comments illustrates how a contract would use the `FungibleTokenCore` trait.

In the context of NEAR Protocol and the NEAR wallet, this kind of encoded data is often used to represent icons, logos, or other graphical elements that need to be displayed in the user interface of a decentralized application (dApp).\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Base64 Encoding**: The string you've shown seems to be a Base64-encoded string. Base64 is a method for encoding binary data into ASCII characters, which allows binary data to be easily transmitted over text-based protocols (like JSON or HTML).\n\n2. **Use in dApps**: In NEAR-based applications, you might use such encoded strings to embed images directly into your HTML or JSON. This is particularly useful for lightweight applications where you want to avoid additional HTTP requests for static assets.\n\n3. **Decoding**: To use this string as an image, it would typically need to be decoded and then used as a source for an image tag in HTML. For example, in a React or vanilla JavaScript application, you might do something like this:\n\n   ```javascript\n   const base64Data = \"voE18vr8bR22G...\"; // Your long encoded string\n   const imgSrc = `data:image/png;base64,${base64Data}`; // Assuming it's a PNG\n\n   // In a React component\n   return <img src={imgSrc} alt=\"Icon\" />;\n   ```\n\n4. **Security Considerations**: Always ensure that any data you are embedding in your application is from a trusted source. Base64 can be a vector for various types of attacks if the data is not properly validated.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the specific function of the encoded string cannot be determined without additional context (such as the preceding code or the surrounding functions), it is likely that this string is intended to represent an icon or graphical asset for the NEAR wallet or a related dApp. If you have access to the broader context of this snippet, additional insights could be provided regarding its specific use case or how it integrates within the larger application architecture."}]}

At the lowest level, there are four steps to this process.\n\n1. Using [`nearAPI`](#imports), we call on `serialize()` to serialize the transaction in [Borsh](https://borsh.io/).\n\n```js\nconst serializedTx = nearAPI.utils.serialize.serialize(\n  nearAPI.transactions.SCHEMA.Transaction,\n  transaction\n);\n```\n\n2. Hash the serialized transaction using a `sha256` cryptographic hashing algorithm.\n\n```js\nconst serializedTxHash = new Uint8Array(sha256.sha256.array(serializedTx));\n```\n\n3. Create a signature with the `keyPair`.\n\n```js\nconst signature = keyPair.sign(serializedTxHash);\n```\n\n4. Construct the signed transaction using `near-api-js` [SignedTransaction class](https://github.com/near/near-api-js/blob/d4d4cf1ac3182fa998b1e004e6782219325a641b/src/transaction.ts#L112-L123).\n\n```js\nconst signedTransaction = new nearAPI.transactions.SignedTransaction({\n  transaction,\n  signature: new nearAPI.transactions.Signature({\n    keyType: transaction.publicKey.keyType,\n    data: signature.signature,\n  }),\n});\n```\n\n### Send Transaction\n\nFinal step is to encode and send the transaction.\n\n- First we serialize transaction into [Borsh](https://borsh.io/), and store the result as `signedSerializedTx`. _(required for all transactions)_\n- Then we send the transaction via [RPC call](/api/rpc/introduction) using the `sendJsonRpc()` method nested inside [`near`](#setting-up-connection-to-near).\n\n```js\n// encodes transaction to serialized Borsh (required for all transactions)\nconst signedSerializedTx = signedTransaction.encode();\n// sends transaction to NEAR blockchain via JSON RPC call and records the result\nconst result = await provider.sendJsonRpc(\"broadcast_tx_commit\", [\n  Buffer.from(signedSerializedTx).toString(\"base64\"),\n]);\n```\n\n### Transaction Results\n\nDetailed transaction results of the transaction are returned in the following format:\n\n```bash\n{\n  status: { SuccessValue: '' },\n  transaction: {\n    signer_id: 'sender.testnet',\n    public_key: 'ed25519:8RazSLHvzj4TBSKGUo5appP7wVeqZNQYjP9hvhF4ZKS2',\n    nonce: 57,\n    receiver_id: 'receiver.testnet',\n    actions: [ [Object] ],\n    signature: 'ed25519:2sK53w6hybSxX7qWShXz6xKnjnYRUW7Co3evEaaggNW6pGSCNPvx7urY4akwnzAbxZGwsKjx8dcVm73qbitntJjz',\n    hash: 'EgGzB73eFxCwZRGcEyCKedLjvvgxhDXcUtq21SqAh79j'\n  },\n  transaction_outcome: {\n    proof: [ [Object] ],\n    block_hash: 'J6cFDzAFkuknHMCEYW2uPQXDvCfSndkJmADVEWJbtTwV',\n    id: 'EgGzB73eFxCwZRGcEyCKedLjvvgxhDXc```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This code snippet outlines the process of creating, signing, and sending a transaction on the NEAR Protocol using the `near-api-js` library. Let's break down each part of the code and explain its functionality.\n\n### 1. Extracting Recent Block Hash\n\n```js\nconst recentBlockHash = nearAPI.utils.serialize.base_decode(\n  accessKey.block_hash\n);\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: This line converts a block hash (which is typically a string representation) into an array of bytes. This is necessary because transactions require the block hash in byte format to ensure that the transaction is being referenced against a recent block (created within the last 24 hours).\n- **Function**: `base_decode` is a utility function found in `nearAPI` that decodes a base-encoded string into its byte representation.\n\n### 2. Constructing the Transaction\n\n```js\nconst transaction = nearAPI.transactions.createTransaction(\n  sender,\n  publicKey,\n  receiver,\n  nonce,\n  actions,\n  recentBlockHash\n);\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: This line constructs a transaction object using the provided parameters.\n  - `sender`: The account that is sending the transaction.\n  - `publicKey`: The public key associated with the sender's account.\n  - `receiver`: The account that will receive the transaction.\n  - `nonce`: A unique number that is incremented with each transaction to prevent replay attacks.\n  - `actions`: The actions that the transaction will perform (e.g., transferring tokens).\n  - `recentBlockHash`: The recently obtained block hash in byte format.\n- **Function**: `createTransaction` is a method that packages these parameters into a transaction object that will be sent to the blockchain.\n\n### 3. Signing the Transaction\n\nThe signing process consists of four steps:\n\n#### Step 1: Serialize the Transaction\n\n```js\nconst serializedTx = nearAPI.utils.serialize.serialize(\n  nearAPI.transactions.SCHEMA.Transaction,\n  transaction\n);\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: Serializes the transaction object into a format suitable for hashing and signing. NEAR uses the Borsh serialization format, which is efficient and allows for easy encoding and decoding of data structures.\n\n#### Step 2: Hash the Serialized Transaction\n\n```js\nconst serializedTxHash = new Uint8Array(sha256.sha256.array(serializedTx));\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: Creates a hash of the serialized transaction using the SHA-256 cryptographic hashing algorithm. This hash will be used to create the signature.\n\n#### Step 3: Create the Signature\n\n```js\nconst signature = keyPair.sign(serializedTxHash);\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: Signs the hashed serialized transaction with the sender's private key using the `keyPair` object. This ensures that only the sender can authorize the transaction.\n\n#### Step 4: Construct the Signed Transaction\n\n```js\nconst signedTransaction = new nearAPI.transactions.SignedTransaction({\n  transaction,\n  signature: new nearAPI.transactions.Signature({\n    keyType: transaction.publicKey.keyType,\n    data: signature.signature,\n  }),\n});\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: Combines the original transaction and its signature into a `SignedTransaction` object, which is necessary for submitting the transaction to the blockchain.\n\n### 4. Sending the Transaction\n\n```js\nconst signedSerializedTx = signedTransaction.encode();\nconst result = await provider.sendJsonRpc(\"broadcast_tx_commit\", [\n  Buffer.from(signedSerializedTx).toString(\"base64\"),\n]);\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: \n  - **Serialization**: Encodes the signed transaction into a serialized Borsh format, which is required for all transactions sent to the NEAR blockchain.\n  - **Sending**: Uses a JSON RPC call to send the serialized transaction to the NEAR blockchain. The method `broadcast_tx_commit` ensures that the transaction is both broadcasted and committed to the blockchain, returning the result of the transaction.\n\n### 5. Transaction Results\n\nThe result of the transaction will be returned in a structured format, which includes:\n\n- `status`: Indicates the outcome of the transaction (e.g., success or failure).\n- `transaction`: Contains details about the transaction itself, including the sender, receiver, actions, and signature.\n- `transaction_outcome`: Provides details about how the transaction was processed, including the block hash and any proof for the transaction outcome.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis code snippet illustrates a typical workflow in the NEAR Protocol for creating and sending transactions. Each step is crucial for ensuring that the transaction is valid, signed, and properly sent to the blockchain, all while ensuring security and integrity through cryptographic methods."}]}

build \"status-message\" first, as it's a dependency of some other examples\n    return sorted(examples, key=lambda x: x.name != \"status-message\")\n```\n- This property scans the examples directory and returns a sorted list of example directories.\n- It prioritizes the \"status-message\" example as it is a dependency for other examples.\n\n### Method: build_artifacts\n```python\ndef build_artifacts(self, cache):\n    for example in self._examples:\n        print(f\"Building {example.name}...\", file=sys.stderr)\n        self._build_artifact(example, cache)\n```\n- This method iterates over the examples and builds each artifact, printing the name of the currently building example to standard error.\n\n### Method: sizes\n```python\ndef sizes(self, cache):\n    self.build_artifacts(cache)\n\n    artifact_paths = glob.glob(self._examples_dir + \"/*/res/*.wasm\")\n    return {\n        os.path.basename(path): os.stat(path).st_size for path in artifact_paths\n    }\n```\n- This method first builds the artifacts and then retrieves the sizes of the generated `.wasm` files in the examples directory.\n- It returns a dictionary mapping the base names of the `.wasm` files to their respective sizes.\n\n### Summary\nThe `ProjectInstance` class encapsulates functionality for managing a NEAR Protocol project, allowing for dynamic branching and artifact building using Docker. It automates the setup of the build environment and keeps track of the artifacts generated, providing their sizes for further analysis. This modular structure makes it easier to manage dependencies and build multiple examples efficiently."}]}

Let’s break it down step by step to understand its functionality and context.\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n```javascript\n// Importing necessary libraries and hooks\nimport React from 'react';\nimport useIsBrowser from '@docusaurus/useIsBrowser'; // Hook to check if the code is running in a browser environment\nimport Gleap from \"gleap\"; // Importing the Gleap JavaScript SDK for error tracking and user feedback\n\n// API key for initializing the Gleap service\nconst GLEAP_API_KEY = 'K2v3kvAJ5XtPzNYSgk4Ulpe5ptgBkIMv';\n\n// Default implementation of the Root component\nexport default function Root({ children }) {\n    // Check if the code is being executed in a browser\n    const isBrowser = useIsBrowser();\n    \n    // If it is running in a browser, initialize Gleap with the provided API key\n    if (isBrowser) {\n        Gleap.initialize(GLEAP_API_KEY);\n    }\n    \n    // Render the child components passed to this Root component\n    return <>{children}</>;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Imports**:\n   - `React`: This is the core library for building user interfaces in JavaScript using components.\n   - `useIsBrowser`: This is a custom hook from Docusaurus that determines whether the code is executing in a browser environment. This is particularly useful for avoiding server-side rendering issues with browser-specific libraries.\n   - `Gleap`: This imports the Gleap SDK, which is a tool used for monitoring errors and gathering user feedback.\n\n2. **GLEAP_API_KEY**:\n   - This is a constant that stores the API key necessary to initialize the Gleap service. It is crucial for authenticating the application with Gleap's backend.\n\n3. **Root Component**:\n   - The `Root` functional component serves as a wrapper for other components (passed as `children`).\n   - It first checks if the current environment is a browser using `useIsBrowser`. This is important because certain libraries, like Gleap, should only be initialized in the browser and not during server-side rendering.\n   - If it's confirmed that the code is running in a browser, it initializes the Gleap service with the provided API key.\n   - Finally, the component returns its children wrapped in a React fragment (`<>...</>`), which allows for grouping a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.\n\n### Purpose\nThe primary purpose of this `Root` component is to set up the Gleap error tracking and feedback system for the application, ensuring that it only runs in the appropriate environment (i.e., the browser). This is a common pattern in React applications, especially those that are server-rendered, to ensure compatibility with various libraries and services that depend on a browser context.\n\n### Additional Context\n- **Docusaurus**: This is a framework for building documentation websites. The use of `useIsBrowser` indicates that this component is likely part of a larger documentation or site built with Docusaurus.\n- **Gleap**: This service provides user feedback and bug reporting functionality, helping developers monitor their applications' performance and user experience.\n\nThis structure allows for clean initialization of third-party services while maintaining the flexibility to render any nested components."}]}

It includes functions for decoding JWTs (JSON Web Tokens), creating JWT tokens, and handling OIDC-specific data structures. Let's break it down:\n\n### Key Components of the Code\n\n1. **Function `decode`**:\n   - This function decodes a JWT and verifies its signature.\n   - It takes a reference to a `DecodingKey` as an argument, which is used for signature verification.\n   - The JWT is split into three parts: the header, the payload (claims), and the signature.\n   - It uses `rsplitn` to split the JWT string, which is formatted as `<header>.<payload>.<signature>`.\n   - After decoding the header and payload from Base64, it verifies the signature using the `verify` method from `jsonwebtoken` library.\n\n```rust\npub fn decode(\n    &self,\n    key: &DecodingKey,\n) -> anyhow::Result<(jwt::Header, IdTokenClaims, String)> {\n    let mut parts = self.as_ref().rsplitn(2, '.');\n    let (Some(signature), Some(message)) = (parts.next(), parts.next()) else {\n        anyhow::bail!(\"could not split into signature and message for OIDC token\");\n    };\n    let mut parts = message.rsplitn(2, '.');\n    let (Some(payload), Some(header)) = (parts.next(), parts.next()) else {\n        anyhow::bail!(\"could not split into payload and header for OIDC token\");\n    };\n    let header: jwt::Header = serde_json::from_slice(&b64_decode(header)?)?;\n    let claims: IdTokenClaims = serde_json::from_slice(&b64_decode(payload)?)?;\n\n    if !jwt::crypto::verify(signature, message.as_bytes(), key, header.alg)? {\n        anyhow::bail!(\"InvalidSignature\");\n    }\n\n    Ok((header, claims, signature.into()))\n}\n```\n\n2. **Function `b64_decode`**:\n   - This utility function decodes a Base64-encoded input using a URL-safe encoding scheme.\n   - It returns a vector of bytes or an error if the decoding fails.\n\n```rust\nfn b64_decode<T: AsRef<[u8]>>(input: T) -> anyhow::Result<Vec<u8>> {\n    base64::Engine::decode(&base64::engine::general_purpose::URL_SAFE_NO_PAD, input)\n        .map_err(Into::into)\n}\n```\n\n3. **Function `create_jwt_token`**:\n   - This function creates a new JWT token.\n   - It constructs the claims needed for the token, such as issuer (`iss`), subject (`sub`), audience (`aud`), and expiration time (`exp`).\n   - The token is then encoded using the `jsonwebtoken` library.\n\n```rust\nfn create_jwt_token(rsa_pem_key: &str) -> String {\n    let private_key_der = rsa_pem_key.as_bytes().to_vec();\n    let aud = \"test_audience\".to_string();\n    \n    let my_claims = IdTokenClaims {\n        iss: format!(\"https://securetoken.google.com/{}\", aud),\n        sub: generate_random_string(7),\n        aud,\n        exp: (Utc::now() + Duration::hours(1)).timestamp() as usize,\n    };\n\n    let token = match encode(\n        &Header::new(Algorithm::RS256),\n        &my_claims,\n        &EncodingKey::from_rsa_pem(&private_key_der).unwrap(),\n    ) {\n        Ok(t) => OidcToken::new(t.as_str()),\n        Err(e) => panic!(\"Failed to encode token: {}\", e),\n    };\n    token.to_string()\n}\n```\n\n4. **Implementations for `OidcToken`**:\n   - The `FromStr` trait allows creating an `OidcToken` from a string.\n   - The `Display` trait is implemented to allow for easy string representation of `OidcToken`.\n   - The `AsRef<str>` trait provides a way to convert `OidcToken` to a string slice.\n\n```rust\nimpl std::str::FromStr for OidcToken {\n    type Err = MpcError;\n\n    fn from_str(s: &str) -> Result<Self, Self::Err> {\n        Ok(Self::new(s))\n    }\n}\n\nimpl std::fmt::Display for OidcToken {\n    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut std::fmt::Formatter<'_>) -> std::fmt::Result {\n        f.write_str(&self.data)\n    }\n}\n\nimpl AsRef<str> for OidcToken {\n    fn as_ref(&self) -> &str {\n        &self.data\n    }\n}\n```\n\n5. **Struct `OidcDigest`**:\n   - This struct represents a digest that includes a node ID, a hash, and a public key.\n   - It implements traits for converting to/from a database-compatible format (`IntoValue`, `FromValue`).\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]\npub struct OidcDigest {\n    pub node_id: usize,\n    pub digest: OidcHash,\n    pub public_key: PublicKey,\n}\n\nimpl KeyKind for OidcDigest {\n    fn kind() -> String {\n        \"OidcDigest\".to_string()\n    }\n}\n\nimpl IntoValue for OidcDigest {\n    fn into_value(self) -> Value {\n        let mut properties = HashMap::new();\n        properties.insert(\n            \"node_id\".to_string(),\n            Value::IntegerValue(self.node_id as i64),\n        );\n        properties.insert(\n            \"digest\".to_string(),\n            Value::StringValue(hex::encode(&self.digest)),\n        );\n        properties.insert(\n            \"public_key\".to_string(),\n            Value::StringValue(serde_json::to_string(&self.public_key).unwrap()),\n        );\n\n        Value::EntityValue {\n            key: Key {\n                path: Some(vec![PathElement {\n                    kind: Some(Self::kind()),\n                    name: Some(self.to_name()),\n                    id: None,\n                }]),\n                partition_id: None,\n            },\n            properties,\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Summary\nThe code handles JWT creation and verification within an OIDC context, supporting the functionalities required for secure token management in a decentralized application. The `decode` function is crucial for validating and parsing tokens, while the `create_jwt_token` function is responsible for generating new tokens with specified claims. The use of traits allows for flexibility and integration into the NEAR Protocol data structures."}]}

By exporting modules like `non_fungible_token`, `fungible_token`, and `storage_management`, developers can easily import all related features from a single entry point, simplifying the use of the NEAR contract standards in their projects.\n\n### Usage\n\nWhen a developer imports from this `index.d.ts`, they can access the functionalities of NFTs, FTs, and storage management without needing to import each module individually. For example:\n\n```typescript\nimport { NonFungibleToken, FungibleToken, storageManagement } from 'near-contract-standards';\n```\n\nThis approach enhances modularity and usability in the NEAR ecosystem, allowing developers to work with the various token standards effectively."}]}

This class is designed to manage key-value pairs stored in NEAR's blockchain storage, allowing developers to create and manipulate collections of data efficiently. Below is a detailed explanation of its components and functionality:\n\n### Overview\n\nThe `LookupMap` class extends from `SubType<DataType>`, which likely provides additional functionality or type constraints relevant to the data being stored. The class primarily deals with storing, retrieving, and managing data in NEAR storage using a unique byte prefix for each collection.\n\n### Constructor\n\n```typescript\nconstructor(readonly keyPrefix: string) {\n  super();\n}\n```\n- The constructor takes a `keyPrefix` parameter, which is a string that serves as a prefix for all keys in the collection. This helps in organizing and differentiating keys in the storage.\n\n### Methods\n\n1. **containsKey**\n   ```typescript\n   containsKey(key: string): boolean {\n     const storageKey = this.keyPrefix + key;\n     return near.storageHasKey(storageKey);\n   }\n   ```\n   - This method checks if a specific key exists in the storage by concatenating the `keyPrefix` with the provided `key`. It uses NEAR's `storageHasKey` method to determine the existence of the key.\n\n2. **get**\n   ```typescript\n   get(key: string, options?: Omit<GetOptions<DataType>, \"serializer\">): DataType | null {\n     const storageKey = this.keyPrefix + key;\n     const value = near.storageReadRaw(encode(storageKey));\n     if (options == undefined) {\n       options = {};\n     }\n     options = this.set_reconstructor(options);\n\n     return getValueWithOptions(this.subtype(), value, options);\n   }\n   ```\n   - Retrieves the value associated with a given key. It reads the raw data from storage, applies any specified options for retrieval, and returns the deserialized value. If the key does not exist, it returns `null`.\n\n3. **remove**\n   ```typescript\n   remove(key: string, options?: Omit<GetOptions<DataType>, \"serializer\">): DataType | null {\n     const storageKey = this.keyPrefix + key;\n\n     if (!near.storageRemove(storageKey)) {\n       return options?.defaultValue ?? null;\n     }\n\n     const value = near.storageGetEvictedRaw();\n\n     return getValueWithOptions(this.subtype(), value, options);\n   }\n   ```\n   - This method removes the data at the specified key. It checks if the removal was successful, and if so, retrieves the evicted value (the value that was removed) for further processing.\n\n4. **set**\n   ```typescript\n   set(key: string, newValue: DataType, options?: GetOptions<DataType>): DataType | null {\n     const storageKey = this.keyPrefix + key;\n     const storageValue = serializeValueWithOptions(newValue, options);\n\n     if (!near.storageWriteRaw(encode(storageKey), storageValue)) {\n       return options?.defaultValue ?? null;\n     }\n\n     const value = near.storageGetEvictedRaw();\n\n     return getValueWithOptions(this.subtype(), value, options);\n   }\n   ```\n   - Stores a new value at the specified key. It serializes the value according to the provided options, writes it to storage, and returns the value that was evicted if the write was successful.\n\n5. **extend**\n   ```typescript\n   extend(keyValuePairs: [string, DataType][], options?: GetOptions<DataType>): void {\n     for (const [key, value] of keyValuePairs) {\n       this.set(key, value, options);\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n   - Allows the addition of multiple key-value pairs to the collection in a single operation, iterating through the provided array and calling `set` for each pair.\n\n6. **serialize**\n   ```typescript\n   serialize(options?: Pick<GetOptions<DataType>, \"serializer\">): Uint8Array {\n     return serializeValueWithOptions(this, options);\n   }\n   ```\n   - Serializes the entire collection for storage, potentially using a specified serializer.\n\n7. **reconstruct**\n   ```typescript\n   static reconstruct<DataType>(data: LookupMap<unknown>): LookupMap<DataType> {\n     return new LookupMap(data.keyPrefix);\n   }\n   ```\n   - A static method that creates a new `LookupMap` instance from existing serialized data, useful for restoring state.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe `LookupMap` class is an essential utility for managing key-value pairs in the NEAR blockchain, providing a robust API for storing, retrieving, and manipulating data. It leverages NEAR's storage methods to handle data efficiently while offering flexibility through options for serialization and deserialization. The structure and methods of this class make it suitable for building decentralized applications that require dynamic data management on the blockchain."}]}

Let's break down the key components of the code to understand its structure and functionality.\n\n### AccessKey Struct\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Clone, Debug)]\npub struct AccessKey {\n    /// The nonce for this access key.\n    pub nonce: Nonce,\n\n    /// Defines permissions for this access key.\n    pub permission: AccessKeyPermission,\n}\n```\n\n- **AccessKey**: This struct represents an access key associated with a NEAR account.\n- **Nonce**: A counter used to prevent replay attacks. Each time an access key is used, the nonce is incremented, ensuring that old transactions cannot be replayed with the same key.\n- **AccessKeyPermission**: An enum defining the permissions associated with this access key, such as full access or specific function call permissions.\n\n### AccessKey Implementation\n\n```rust\nimpl AccessKey {\n    pub fn full_access() -> Self {\n        Self {\n            nonce: 0,\n            permission: AccessKeyPermission::FullAccess,\n        }\n    }\n\n    pub fn function_call_access(\n        receiver_id: &AccountId,\n        method_names: &[&str],\n        allowance: Option<NearToken>,\n    ) -> Self {\n        Self {\n            nonce: 0,\n            permission: AccessKeyPermission::FunctionCall(FunctionCallPermission {\n                receiver_id: receiver_id.clone().into(),\n                method_names: method_names.iter().map(|s| s.to_string()).collect(),\n                allowance,\n            }),\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n- **full_access()**: A constructor function that creates an access key with full permissions and a nonce set to 0.\n- **function_call_access()**: This function creates an access key that restricts the actions to specific function calls on a smart contract. It takes parameters for the receiver's account ID, a list of allowed method names, and an optional allowance for gas fees.\n\n### AccessKeyInfo Struct\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Clone, Debug)]\npub struct AccessKeyInfo {\n    pub public_key: PublicKey,\n    pub access_key: AccessKey,\n}\n```\n\n- **AccessKeyInfo**: This struct combines an access key with the associated public key. This is useful for displaying or managing access keys in a more comprehensive manner.\n\n### AccessKeyPermission Enum\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Clone, Debug)]\npub enum AccessKeyPermission {\n    FunctionCall(FunctionCallPermission),\n    FullAccess,\n}\n```\n\n- **AccessKeyPermission**: This enum defines the types of permissions that an access key can have:\n  - **FunctionCall**: Allows specific function calls on a smart contract with defined parameters.\n  - **FullAccess**: Grants unrestricted access to the account.\n\n### FunctionCallPermission Struct\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Clone, Debug)]\npub struct FunctionCallPermission {\n    pub allowance: Option<NearToken>,\n    pub receiver_id: String,\n    pub method_names: Vec<String>,\n}\n```\n\n- **FunctionCallPermission**: This struct defines the limitations of a function call access key:\n  - **Allowance**: Specifies a limit on the balance that can be used for gas and transaction fees. If it is `None`, it means unlimited allowance.\n  - **Receiver ID**: A string representing the account ID that can be called by this access key.\n  - **Method Names**: A list of method names that are allowed to be called. An empty list means any method can be called.\n\n### Conversion Implementations\n\nThe code includes implementations for converting between different representations of access keys and their associated data structures:\n\n```rust\nimpl From<near_primitives::views::AccessKeyInfoView> for AccessKeyInfo {\n    fn from(view: near_primitives::views::AccessKeyInfoView) -> Self {\n        Self {\n            public_key: PublicKey(view.public_key),\n            access_key: view.access_key.into(),\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n- This conversion allows the code to take an access key information view from NEAR's primitives and convert it into the `AccessKeyInfo` struct, making it easier to work with the data in a more structured way.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis code snippet plays a crucial role in managing access control in the NEAR Protocol by defining how access keys are structured, how permissions are assigned, and how these keys can be created and converted. Understanding this code is essential for developers working with NEAR smart contracts, as access keys are fundamental to ensuring the security and integrity of account actions on the blockchain."}]}

This is a simple example that shows how to specify two tables, filter blockchain transaction data for a specific type of transaction and its contents, and save the data to the database.\n\n:::tip\n\nThis indexer can be found by [following this link](https://dev.near.org/#/dataplatform.near/widget/QueryApi.App?selectedIndexerPath=bucanero.near/hype-indexer).\n\n:::\n\n## Defining the Database Schema\n\nThe first step to creating an indexer is to define the database schema. This is done by editing the `schema.sql` file in the code editor. The schema for this indexer looks like this:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE\n  \"posts\" (\n    \"id\" TEXT NOT NULL,\n    \"account_id\" VARCHAR NOT NULL,\n    \"block_height\" DECIMAL(58, 0) NOT NULL,\n    \"block_timestamp\" DECIMAL(20, 0) NOT NULL,\n    \"receipt_id\" VARCHAR NOT NULL,\n    \"content\" TEXT NOT NULL,\n    CONSTRAINT \"posts_pkey\" PRIMARY KEY (\"id\")\n  );\n\nCREATE TABLE\n  \"comments\" (\n    \"id\" SERIAL NOT NULL,\n    \"post_id\" TEXT NOT NULL,\n    \"account_id\" VARCHAR NOT NULL,\n    \"block_height\" DECIMAL(58, 0) NOT NULL,\n    \"block_timestamp\" DECIMAL(20, 0) NOT NULL,\n    \"receipt_id\" VARCHAR NOT NULL,\n    \"content\" TEXT NOT NULL,\n    CONSTRAINT \"comments_pkey\" PRIMARY KEY (\"id\")\n  );\n```\n\nThis schema defines two tables: `posts` and `comments`. The `posts` table has columns:\n\n- `id`: a unique identifier for each row in the table\n- `account_id`: the account ID of the user who created the post\n- `block_height`: the height of the block in which the post was created\n- `block_timestamp`: the timestamp of the block in which the post was created\n- `receipt_id`: the receipt ID of the transaction that created the post\n- `content`: the content of the post\n\nThe `comments` table has columns:\n\n- `id`: a unique identifier for each row in the table\n- `post_id`: the ID of the post that the comment was made on\n- `account_id`: the account ID of the user who created the comment\n- `block_height`: the height of the block in which the comment was created\n- `block_timestamp`: the timestamp of the block in which the comment was created\n- `receipt_id`: the receipt ID of the transaction that created the comment\n- `content`: the content of the comment\n\n## Defining the indexing logic\n\nThe next step is to define the indexing logic. This is done by editing the `indexingLogic.js` file in the code editor. The logic for this indexer can be divided into two parts:\n\n1. Filtering blockchain transactions for a specific type of transaction\n2. Saving the data from the filtered transactions to the database\n\n### Filtering Blockchain transactions\n\nThe first part of the logic is to filter blockchain transactions for a specific type of transaction. This is done by using the `getBlock` function. This function takes in a block and a context and returns a promise. The block is a Near Protocol block, and the context is a set of helper methods to retrieve and commit state. The `getBlock` function is called for every block on the blockchain.\n\nThe `getBlock` function for this indexer looks like this:\n\n```js\nimport { Block } from \"@near-lake/primitives\";\n\nasync function getBlock(block: Block, context) {\n  const SOCIAL_DB = \"social.near\";\n\n  function base64decode(encodedValue) {\n    let buff = Buffer.from(encodedValue, \"base64\");\n    return JSON.parse(buff.toString(\"utf-8\"));\n  }\n\n  function get_near_social_posts_comments(\n    block_type = block,\n    DB = SOCIAL_DB,\n    decodeFunction = base64decode\n  ) {\n    const nearSocialPostsComments = block_type\n      .actions()\n      .filter((action) => action.receiverId === DB)\n      .flatMap((action) =>\n        action.operations\n          .map((operation) => operation[\"FunctionCall\"])\n          .filter((operation) => operation?.methodName === \"set\")\n          .map((functionCallOperation```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The provided code snippet is part of a tutorial that explains how to create an indexer for the NEAR blockchain. This indexer is designed to track posts and comments that contain specific keywords (\"PEPE\" or \"DOGE\") and save them into a GraphQL database. Below is a detailed breakdown of the code and its components:\n\n### Overview\nThe indexer operates by listening for new transactions on the NEAR blockchain and filtering them based on the content of posts and comments. When a relevant transaction is detected, it saves the data into two predefined tables: `posts` and `comments`.\n\n### Database Schema\nThe schema defines the structure of the `posts` and `comments` tables using SQL. Here's a breakdown:\n\n#### Posts Table\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE\n  \"posts\" (\n    \"id\" TEXT NOT NULL,\n    \"account_id\" VARCHAR NOT NULL,\n    \"block_height\" DECIMAL(58, 0) NOT NULL,\n    \"block_timestamp\" DECIMAL(20, 0) NOT NULL,\n    \"receipt_id\" VARCHAR NOT NULL,\n    \"content\" TEXT NOT NULL,\n    CONSTRAINT \"posts_pkey\" PRIMARY KEY (\"id\")\n  );\n```\n- **id**: A unique identifier for each post.\n- **account_id**: The ID of the user who created the post.\n- **block_height**: The block height at which the post was created.\n- **block_timestamp**: The timestamp of the block.\n- **receipt_id**: The transaction receipt ID.\n- **content**: The actual content of the post.\n\n#### Comments Table\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE\n  \"comments\" (\n    \"id\" SERIAL NOT NULL,\n    \"post_id\" TEXT NOT NULL,\n    \"account_id\" VARCHAR NOT NULL,\n    \"block_height\" DECIMAL(58, 0) NOT NULL,\n    \"block_timestamp\" DECIMAL(20, 0) NOT NULL,\n    \"receipt_id\" VARCHAR NOT NULL,\n    \"content\" TEXT NOT NULL,\n    CONSTRAINT \"comments_pkey\" PRIMARY KEY (\"id\")\n  );\n```\n- **id**: A unique identifier for each comment.\n- **post_id**: The ID of the post that this comment is associated with.\n- **account_id**: The ID of the user who created the comment.\n- **block_height**: The block height at which the comment was created.\n- **block_timestamp**: The timestamp of the block.\n- **receipt_id**: The transaction receipt ID.\n- **content**: The actual content of the comment.\n\n### Indexing Logic\nThe indexing logic is implemented in `indexingLogic.js`. It consists of two main parts: filtering blockchain transactions and saving the filtered data to the database.\n\n#### Filtering Blockchain Transactions\nThe code snippet provided starts outlining the `getBlock` function, which is responsible for processing each block of the blockchain. Here's a brief explanation of the key components:\n\n```js\nimport { Block } from \"@near-lake/primitives\";\n\nasync function getBlock(block: Block, context) {\n  const SOCIAL_DB = \"social.near\";\n\n  function base64decode(encodedValue) {\n    let buff = Buffer.from(encodedValue, \"base64\");\n    return JSON.parse(buff.toString(\"utf-8\"));\n  }\n\n  function get_near_social_posts_comments(\n    block_type = block,\n    DB = SOCIAL_DB,\n    decodeFunction = base64decode\n  ) {\n    const nearSocialPostsComments = block_type\n      .actions()\n      .filter((action) => action.receiverId === DB)\n      .flatMap((action) =>\n        action.operations\n          .map((operation) => operation[\"FunctionCall\"])\n          .filter((operation) => operation?.methodName === \"set\")\n          .map((functionCallOperation) => {\n            // Additional processing logic would go here\n          })\n      );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- **Importing Block**: The `Block` type is imported from the NEAR primitives package to represent a block on the NEAR blockchain.\n\n- **getBlock Function**: This asynchronous function takes a `block` and a `context` as parameters. It processes the block to filter and extract relevant transaction data.\n\n- **base64decode Function**: This utility function decodes base64-encoded strings, which is useful for processing transaction data that may be encoded.\n\n- **get_near_social_posts_comments Function**: This function processes the actions within a block:\n  - It filters actions directed to the `social.near` contract.\n  - It then maps the operations to find those that are function calls with the method name `set`, which presumably indicates a post or comment submission.\n\n### Summary\nThis code snippet provides a foundational understanding of how to build an indexer for the NEAR blockchain using the QueryAPI. It includes the definition of database schemas for storing posts and comments, as well as the initial steps for filtering transactions. The tutorial is aimed at developers looking to create data-driven applications on the NEAR Protocol by indexing blockchain data effectively. \n\nFor further implementation, the logic for saving the filtered data to the database would need to be added, alongside error handling and additional processing as required."}]}

This section is particularly focused on potential errors that can arise when calling functions within the runtime environment and during interactions with external systems.\n\n### Breakdown of the Code Snippet\n\nThe code snippet consists of several enumerated variants, each representing a specific type of error that can be encountered. Here's a detailed explanation of each error type:\n\n1. **IteratorWasInvalidated { iterator_index: u64 }**:\n   - This error indicates that an iterator (used to traverse collections of data) has been invalidated, meaning it can no longer be used. The `iterator_index` provides context about which iterator was invalidated.\n\n2. **MemoryAccessViolation**:\n   - This error occurs when the smart contract attempts to access memory that is outside its allocated bounds, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.\n\n3. **InvalidReceiptIndex { receipt_index: u64 }**:\n   - This indicates that the VM logic returned an invalid index for a receipt, which may be a result of a logical error in the contract's execution.\n\n4. **InvalidIteratorIndex { iterator_index: u64 }**:\n   - This error occurs when an operation attempts to access an iterator using an index that does not exist.\n\n5. **InvalidAccountId**:\n   - This signifies that the VM logic returned an account ID that is not valid, likely due to formatting issues or non-existent accounts.\n\n6. **InvalidMethodName**:\n   - This error indicates that the method name provided is invalid, possibly due to a typo or an unsupported operation.\n\n7. **InvalidPublicKey**:\n   - This error suggests that the public key provided in the operations does not conform to the expected format or is invalid.\n\n8. **ProhibitedInView { method_name: String }**:\n   - This indicates that the specified method is not allowed to be called in a view context, which is meant for non-state-changing operations.\n\n9. **NumberOfLogsExceeded { limit: u64 }**:\n   - This error occurs when the total number of logs generated during execution exceeds the predefined limit.\n\n10. **KeyLengthExceeded { length: u64, limit: u64 }**:\n    - This signifies that the length of a storage key exceeds the allowed maximum length.\n\n11. **ValueLengthExceeded { length: u64, limit: u64 }**:\n    - This indicates that the length of a storage value exceeds the allowed maximum length.\n\n12. **TotalLogLengthExceeded { length: u64, limit: u64 }**:\n    - This error occurs when the total length of all logs generated exceeds the allowed limit.\n\n13. **NumberPromisesExceeded { number_of_promises: u64, limit: u64 }**:\n    - This indicates that the number of promises (asynchronous operations) created during a function call exceeded the limit.\n\n14. **NumberInputDataDependenciesExceeded { number_of_input_data_dependencies: u64, limit: u64 }**:\n    - This error occurs when the number of input data dependencies for a function call exceeds the allowed limit.\n\n15. **ReturnedValueLengthExceeded { length: u64, limit: u64 }**:\n    - This indicates that the length of the value returned from a function call exceeds the maximum allowed length.\n\n16. **ContractSizeExceeded { size: u64, limit: u64 }**:\n    - This error occurs when the size of the deployed contract exceeds the allowed limit.\n\n17. **Deprecated { method_name: String }**:\n    - This signifies that the host function being invoked has been deprecated and should not be used.\n\n### ExternalError and StorageError\n\nThe following section of the snippet introduces two additional enumerations that represent errors related to external interactions and storage integrity:\n\n- **ExternalError**: This enum encapsulates errors that arise from external interactions, particularly when the runtime communicates with validators or accesses external state. The two variants are:\n  - **StorageError(StorageError)**: An unexpected error typically related to node storage corruption, potentially indicating that the input state is invalid or malicious.\n  - **ValidatorError(EpochError)**: An error that occurs when accessing validator information, often within the context of the epoch manager.\n\n- **StorageError**: This error type highlights issues related to state or storage corruption, indicating that there may be data integrity issues that need to be addressed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe provided code outlines a comprehensive list of error types that can occur during the execution of smart contracts on the NEAR Protocol. Each error variant is designed to provide clear feedback to developers, enabling them to diagnose and resolve issues efficiently. Understanding these errors is crucial for writing robust and secure smart contracts on the NEAR platform."}]}

Here's a breakdown of the key components of this snippet:\n\n### Breakdown of the Code Snippet\n\n1. **Context and Structure**:\n   - The snippet shows parts of a response typically received from NEAR's RPC (Remote Procedure Call) endpoints when querying transaction results.\n   - It contains information about actions taken (like transfers), the receipts generated, as well as the outcomes of these actions.\n\n2. **Receipt Entries**:\n   Each entry represents a transaction receipt with the following structure:\n   - **`predecessor_id`**: The account that initiated the transaction. In this case, it’s generally the `system` account.\n   - **`receipt`**: Contains the action details performed in this receipt.\n     - **`Action`**: This field contains the actual action taken, which is a transfer action in this case.\n       - **`actions`**: An array of actions. Here, it includes a `Transfer` action with a specified amount as a deposit.\n       - **`gas_price`**: The price of gas for executing this action (set to \"0\" in this case).\n       - **`input_data_ids`** and **`output_data_receivers`**: These fields are used for tracking data inputs and outputs related to the transaction.\n       - **`signer_id`**: The account that signed the transaction (in this case, `bowen`).\n       - **`signer_public_key`**: The public key corresponding to the signer’s account.\n   - **`receipt_id`**: Unique identifier for the receipt.\n   - **`receiver_id`**: The account that will receive the actions defined in the receipt (in this case, also `bowen`).\n\n3. **Receipts Outcome**:\n   - This section provides details of the outcomes resulting from the processed receipts.\n   - Each outcome entry includes:\n     - **`block_hash`**: The hash of the block where this receipt was included.\n     - **`id`**: Unique identifier for the outcome.\n     - **`outcome`**: Contains details about what occurred during the execution of the action:\n       - **`executor_id`**: The account that executed the action.\n       - **`gas_burnt`**: Amount of gas consumed during the execution.\n       - **`logs`**: Any logs generated (e.g., messages regarding the transaction).\n       - **`receipt_ids`**: An array of receipt IDs that were generated as part of this transaction.\n       - **`status`**: Indicates the result of the execution, either a successful receipt ID or a success value.\n       - **`tokens_burnt`**: The number of tokens burnt during the execution, typically due to gas fees.\n     - **`proof`**: Contains cryptographic proofs of the validity of the outcome, which can include hash values and directions in the Merkle tree.\n\n### Example of Transfer Action\n\nThe most notable action in the provided snippet is the transfer of tokens, which is represented in the `Transfer` action. For instance:\n```json\n{\n  \"Transfer\": {\n    \"deposit\": \"19200274886926125000\"\n  }\n}\n```\nThis indicates that a transfer of `19,200,274,886,926,125,000` yoctoNEAR (the smallest unit of NEAR) was made.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis snippet is a typical representation of how transactions and their outcomes are structured in NEAR Protocol. It allows developers to understand the flow of tokens between accounts, how these actions are processed, and the results of those actions within the blockchain's state. This information is critical for debugging, transaction tracking, and understanding the overall flow of decentralized applications built on NEAR."}]}

Let's break down the components of this code for clarity:\n\n### Explanation of the Code Snippet\n\n1. **Conditional Compilation with `#[cfg(...)]`:**\n   - The `#[cfg(...)]` attribute is a Rust feature that allows you to include or exclude items based on compile-time conditions. In this code snippet, the conditions being checked are `feature = \"__abi-embed-checked\"` and `feature = \"__abi-generate\"`.\n\n2. **Module Definitions:**\n   - The snippet defines two modules (`abi_embed` and `abi_generator`) that are conditionally included based on the features enabled in the Cargo.toml file of the project.\n\n   ```rust\n   #[cfg(feature = \"__abi-embed-checked\")]\n   mod abi_embed;\n   ```\n   - This line means that the `abi_embed` module will only be compiled if the feature `__abi-embed-checked` is enabled. If this feature is not enabled, the `abi_embed` module will not be included in the build.\n\n   ```rust\n   #[cfg(feature = \"__abi-generate\")]\n   mod abi_generator;\n   ```\n   - Similarly, this line indicates that the `abi_generator` module will only be compiled if the `__abi-generate` feature is enabled.\n\n3. **Public Re-exports:**\n   - The `pub use` statements allow for re-exporting specific items from the modules so they can be accessed as part of the current module's public interface.\n\n   ```rust\n   #[cfg(feature = \"__abi-embed-checked\")]\n   pub use abi_embed::embed;\n   ```\n   - If the `__abi-embed-checked` feature is enabled and the `abi_embed` module is included, the `embed` item from `abi_embed` will be made available at the current module level.\n\n   ```rust\n   #[cfg(feature = \"__abi-generate\")]\n   pub use abi_generator::generate;\n   ```\n   - Similarly, if the `__abi-generate` feature is enabled, the `generate` item from `abi_generator` will be made publicly accessible.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, this code snippet is implementing feature-based modularity in Rust. It allows the NEAR Protocol's SDK to include or exclude certain functionalities related to ABI (Application Binary Interface) embedding and generation based on the features specified at compile time. This approach enhances the flexibility and maintainability of the code by ensuring that only the necessary components are included in the final build, depending on the use case or requirements of the project.\n\n### Example of Usage in `Cargo.toml`\n\nTo use these features, you would typically specify them in your `Cargo.toml` like this:\n\n```toml\n[features]\n__abi-embed-checked = []\n__abi-generate = []\n```\n\nYou can then enable these features when building the project:\n\n```bash\ncargo build --features \"__abi-embed-checked\"\n```\n\nThis command will compile the project with the `abi_embed` module included, along with the `embed` function being available for use."}]}

The string itself looks like a Base64 encoded string, which is commonly used to represent binary data in an ASCII string format.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of what this might imply within the context of the NEAR Protocol, specifically in the `packages/ethereum-wallets/src/lib/icon.ts` file:\n\n### Explanation of the Code Snippet\n\n1. **Purpose**: \n   - This snippet seems to be part of an implementation that deals with wallet icons for Ethereum wallets. It could be a constant or a function returning some form of icon data that needs to be displayed in a user interface.\n\n2. **Base64 Encoding**:\n   - The string looks like it is Base64 encoded. Base64 encoding is a method of converting binary data into a text format using only ASCII characters. This is often used to embed images or files directly into HTML or CSS, or to transmit binary data over channels that only support text.\n\n3. **Usage**:\n   - In the context of dApps or wallet interfaces, such data could be used to display wallet icons in a UI component. By decoding the Base64 string, you would retrieve the original binary data (like an image) that can be rendered on a webpage or application.\n\n### Decoding Base64 Example\n\nTo decode this string in JavaScript (for example), you could use the `atob` function if it's a valid Base64 string. Here’s how you might do it:\n\n```javascript\n// Decoding the Base64 encoded string\nconst base64String = \"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\";\n\n// Use atob to decode\nconst decodedData = atob(base64String);\n\n// Now `decodedData` contains the binary data, which you can process further\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the provided snippet is likely a Base64 encoded string representing an icon or image relevant to Ethereum wallets in the NEAR ecosystem. Understanding how to decode such strings is essential for displaying the corresponding icons in a user interface effectively. If you have specific questions about how this data is used within the NEAR Protocol or other related implementations, feel free to ask!"}]}

Below, I'll explain the key components, functionality, and structure of the code.\n\n### Breakdown of the Code\n\n1. **SVG Paths**:  \n   The initial part of the snippet contains several `<path>` elements within an `<svg>`. These are likely used to render an icon or graphic related to the staking functionality. The `opacity` attributes control the visibility of certain parts of the SVG graphic.\n\n2. **Input Field**:  \n   The code includes an input field that allows the user to enter the amount of ETH they wish to stake:\n   ```jsx\n   <input\n     disabled={!state.sender}\n     className=\"LidoStakeFormInputContainerSpan2Input\"\n     value={state.strEther}\n     onChange={(e) => State.update({ strEther: e.target.value })}\n     placeholder=\"Amount\"\n   />\n   ```\n   - `disabled={!state.sender}`: The input is disabled unless the user is connected (indicated by `state.sender`).\n   - `value={state.strEther}`: The input's value is bound to the `strEther` state, representing the amount the user wants to stake.\n   - `onChange`: Updates the state with the input value as the user types.\n\n3. **MAX Button**:  \n   This button allows the user to quickly set the staking amount to the maximum they can stake, minus a small fee:\n   ```jsx\n   <button\n     className=\"LidoStakeFormInputContainerSpan3Content\"\n     disabled={!state.sender}\n     onClick={() => {\n       State.update({\n         strEther: (state.balance > 0.05\n           ? parseFloat(state.balance) - 0.05\n           : 0\n         ).toFixed(2),\n       });\n     }}\n   >\n     <span className=\"LidoStakeFormInputContainerSpan3Max\">MAX</span>\n   </button>\n   ```\n   - The button is also disabled unless the user is connected.\n   - On click, it calculates the maximum amount by subtracting a fee of 0.05 from the user's balance and updates the `strEther` state.\n\n4. **Submit Button**:  \n   This button allows the user to submit their staking request:\n   ```jsx\n   {!!state.sender ? (\n     <button\n       className=\"LidoStakeFormSubmitContainer\"\n       onClick={() => submitEthers(state.strEther, state.sender)}\n     >\n       <span>Submit</span>\n     </button>\n   ) : (\n     <Web3Connect\n       className=\"LidoStakeFormSubmitContainer\"\n       connectLabel=\"Connect with Web3\"\n     />\n   )}\n   ```\n   - If the user is connected (i.e., `state.sender` is truthy), the \"Submit\" button is shown. When clicked, it triggers the `submitEthers` function with the amount and the user address.\n   - If the user is not connected, a `Web3Connect` component is shown, prompting the user to connect their Web3 wallet.\n\n5. **Footer Information**:  \n   The footer section provides additional information about the transaction:\n   ```jsx\n   <div className=\"LidoFooterContainer\">\n     {state.sender && (\n       <div className=\"LidoFooterRaw\">\n         <div className=\"LidoFooterRawLeft\">You will receive</div>\n         <div className=\"LidoFooterRawRight\">${state.strEther ?? 0} stETH</div>\n       </div>\n     )}\n     <div className=\"LidoFooterRaw\">\n       <div className=\"LidoFooterRawLeft\">Exchange rate</div>\n       <div className=\"LidoFooterRawRight\">1 ETH = 1 stETH</div>\n     </div>\n     <div className=\"LidoFooterRaw\">\n       <div className=\"LidoFooterRawLeft\">Reward fee</div>\n       <div className=\"LidoFooterRawRight\">10%</div>\n     </div>\n   </div>\n   ```\n   - Displays how much stETH the user will receive based on their input.\n   - Shows the current exchange rate and the reward fee associated with staking.\n\n### Summary\nThis code snippet builds a user interface component for staking Ether through Lido on the NEAR Protocol. It includes input handling, a maximum stake button, and submission logic, while providing users with relevant information about their transaction. The use of state management is critical to ensure that the UI reflects the user's interactions accurately.\n\nFor further exploration, you can build and deploy components using the NEAR ecosystem, as mentioned in the note at the end of the snippet.

In JavaScript, you can do this using the following code:\n\n```javascript\n// Define the Base64 encoded string\nconst base64String = `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`;\n\n// Decode the Base64 string\nconst decodedData = atob(base64String);\n\n// To handle the bytes, you could convert it to a Blob or an Image\nconst byteCharacters = new Uint8Array(decodedData.length);\nfor (let i = 0; i < decodedData.length; i++) {\n    byteCharacters[i] = decodedData.charCodeAt(i);\n}\n\n// Create a Blob from the byte array\nconst blob = new Blob([byteCharacters], { type: 'image/png' }); // Assuming the image is a PNG\nconst imageUrl = URL.createObjectURL(blob);\n\n// Now you can use the imageUrl in an <img> tag\nconsole.log(imageUrl); // This can be used in an <img src=\"{imageUrl}\" />\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The provided code snippet is a Base64-encoded string likely representing an image or icon for use in the NEAR wallet interface.\n- By decoding it, you can retrieve the original binary data and potentially display it as an image in your application.\n- Understanding and working with Base64-encoded assets is common in web development for optimizing asset delivery and embedding images directly into HTML/CSS."}]}

The main purpose of this snippet is to test the Borsh serialization schema for a `TreeMap` data structure. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n1. **Feature Flag**:\n   ```rust\n   #[cfg(feature = \"abi\")]\n   ```\n   This attribute indicates that the following code will only compile if the `abi` feature is enabled. Features in Rust allow conditional compilation, which means this code is likely part of a larger codebase where it might not always be necessary.\n\n2. **Test Function**:\n   ```rust\n   #[test]\n   fn test_borsh_schema() {\n   ```\n   This defines a test function named `test_borsh_schema`. The `#[test]` attribute tells the Rust compiler to treat this function as a test case that should be run when executing the test suite.\n\n3. **Struct Definition**:\n   ```rust\n   #[derive(\n       borsh::BorshSerialize, borsh::BorshDeserialize, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord,\n   )]\n   struct NoSchemaStruct;\n   ```\n   Here, a simple struct named `NoSchemaStruct` is defined. It derives several traits:\n   - `borsh::BorshSerialize` and `borsh::BorshDeserialize`: These traits are related to Borsh, a binary serialization format used by NEAR for efficient data encoding and decoding.\n   - `PartialEq`, `Eq`, `PartialOrd`, `Ord`: These traits are for comparison, allowing instances of `NoSchemaStruct` to be compared for equality and ordering.\n\n4. **Schema Declaration Assertion**:\n   ```rust\n   assert_eq!(\n       \"TreeMap\".to_string(),\n       <TreeMap<NoSchemaStruct, NoSchemaStruct> as borsh::BorshSchema>::declaration()\n   );\n   ```\n   This assertion checks that the declaration of the `TreeMap` type (which uses `NoSchemaStruct` for both its key and value types) matches the string `\"TreeMap\"`. The `BorshSchema` trait is likely implemented for `TreeMap`, allowing it to provide a string description of its schema.\n\n5. **Definitions Collection**:\n   ```rust\n   let mut defs = Default::default();\n   <TreeMap<NoSchemaStruct, NoSchemaStruct> as borsh::BorshSchema>::add_definitions_recursively(&mut defs);\n   ```\n   A mutable variable `defs` is initialized using the default value. The `add_definitions_recursively` method is called on the `TreeMap`, populating `defs` with the schema definitions associated with the `TreeMap<NoSchemaStruct, NoSchemaStruct>`. This suggests that `defs` will contain a comprehensive representation of the schema for serialization purposes.\n\n6. **Snapshot Assertion**:\n   ```rust\n   insta::assert_snapshot!(format!(\"{:#?}\", defs));\n   ```\n   Finally, this line uses the `insta` crate to create a snapshot of the `defs` variable's formatted output. The `assert_snapshot!` macro checks that the current output matches a previously saved snapshot. This can be useful for regression testing to ensure that changes to the schema do not unintentionally modify its structure.\n\n### Summary\n\nOverall, this code snippet is part of a unit test designed to verify the proper functioning of the Borsh serialization schema for the `TreeMap` data structure within the NEAR Protocol SDK. It ensures that the `TreeMap` can be correctly serialized and that its schema adheres to expected definitions. The use of Rust's testing features, along with Borsh serialization traits, demonstrates a structured approach to validating behavioral contracts in blockchain development."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain the following code snippet from NEAR repository file `packages/meteor-wallet/src/index.ts`:\n```export { setupMeteorWallet } from \"./lib/meteor-wallet\";\n```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The code snippet you provided is a simple export statement in TypeScript, which is commonly used in modular programming. Let’s break down the components of this line in the context of the NEAR repository:\n\n```typescript\nexport { setupMeteorWallet } from \"./lib/meteor-wallet\";\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Export Statement**:\n   - The `export` keyword is used to make certain variables, functions, or classes available to other modules. This allows other parts of the codebase to import and use the `setupMeteorWallet` function.\n\n2. **Destructured Export**:\n   - The curly braces `{}` indicate that we are exporting a specific member of the module rather than the entire module. In this case, only `setupMeteorWallet` is being exported.\n\n3. **Source Module**:\n   - The `from \"./lib/meteor-wallet\"` part specifies the source module from which `setupMeteorWallet` is being imported. This means that `setupMeteorWallet` is defined in the `meteor-wallet.ts` file located in the `lib` directory relative to the current file (`index.ts`).\n\n### Context in NEAR\n\nIn the context of the NEAR Protocol, this line is likely part of the wallet functionality related to the Meteor framework. The `setupMeteorWallet` function could be responsible for initializing or configuring a wallet that interacts with the NEAR blockchain.\n\n### Usage Example\n\nHere’s a hypothetical example of how `setupMeteorWallet` might be imported and used in another module:\n\n```typescript\nimport { setupMeteorWallet } from './index';\n\n// Initialize the wallet\nconst wallet = setupMeteorWallet({\n  networkId: 'testnet',\n  nodeUrl: 'https://rpc.testnet.near.org',\n  // Other configuration options...\n});\n\n// Now `wallet` can be used to interact with NEAR\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis export statement is a modular way of organizing code in TypeScript, allowing developers to neatly encapsulate functionality and promote reusability across different parts of the application. The actual implementation details of `setupMeteorWallet` would be found in the `meteor-wallet.ts` file, where the logic for setting up the wallet is defined."}]}

This is common in TypeScript to allow types to be reused across different parts of an application.\n\n2. **Type Definition**:\n   - `type AssertionResponse = { ... }`: This defines a new type named `AssertionResponse`. It describes the shape of an object that can be used to represent the response from an assertion (typically in the context of authentication).\n\n3. **Properties of `AssertionResponse`**:\n   - **`authenticatorAttachment`**: \n     - This property indicates the type of authenticator used. It can be either `'platform'` (indicating that the authenticator is built into the device, like a fingerprint reader on a smartphone) or `'cross-platform'` (indicating an external authenticator, such as a hardware security key).\n   \n   - **`getClientExtensionResults`**:\n     - This is a method that returns any additional results from client extensions. The return type is specified as `any`, meaning that it can return any data type. This is useful for obtaining information about any extensions that might be used in the authentication process.\n\n   - **`id`**:\n     - This is a string representing a unique identifier for the assertion response. It is used to distinguish different authentication sessions or responses.\n\n   - **`rawId`**:\n     - Similar to `id`, this property holds a string that represents the raw identifier, which could be in a different format than `id`. This can be useful for debugging or logging purposes.\n\n   - **`response`**:\n     - This property is an object that contains detailed information about the authentication response:\n       - **`authenticatorData`**: A string that contains data produced by the authenticator during the authentication process.\n       - **`clientDataJSON`**: A string that represents the client data in JSON format, which typically includes information about the authentication request and the origin.\n       - **`signature`**: A string that contains the cryptographic signature generated by the authenticator, proving the authenticity of the response.\n       - **`userHandle`**: A string that represents an optional user identifier, which can be used to refer to the authenticated user.\n\n   - **`type`**:\n     - This property is a string literal type with a fixed value of `'public-key'`. This indicates that the authentication method used is based on public key cryptography, which is common in modern authentication systems.\n\n### Summary\nThe `AssertionResponse` type encapsulates the structure of the response received from a biometric authentication system using the Ed25519 algorithm. It provides essential properties and methods necessary for handling the authentication process, ensuring that developers have a clear and typed interface to work with when implementing authentication features in their applications. \n\nThis structured approach helps enhance code quality, maintainability, and type safety, which are key benefits of using TypeScript in projects."}]}

Let's break down the key components and their significance:\n\n### Overview\n\nThe Fungible Token standard provides a framework for creating tokens that can be transferred and interacted with using smart contracts on the NEAR blockchain. The snippet includes the following key points:\n\n- **Data Representation**: Token amounts are represented as Base-10 strings to avoid limitations associated with JSON parsing of large integers (greater than `2**53`). This ensures that amounts can be accurately transmitted and processed without overflow errors.\n\n- **Storage Management**: While storage management is crucial for tracking changes (like adding and removing tokens), details are specified in a separate Storage Standard document. This modularity helps in maintaining a clean separation of concerns within the codebase.\n\n- **Security**: To enhance security, contracts should not retain any access keys, preventing unauthorized modifications or deletions.\n\n### Interface Description\n\nThe interface includes several function definitions, each serving a specific purpose:\n\n#### 1. `ft_transfer`\n\nThis function allows users to transfer tokens to another account. \n\n- **Requirements**: \n  - The caller must attach a minimum deposit of `1 yoctoⓃ`.\n  - The caller must have a sufficient token balance.\n\n- **Arguments**:\n  - `receiver_id`: The recipient's NEAR account ID.\n  - `amount`: The token quantity to transfer, represented as a string.\n  - `memo`: An optional field for additional information.\n\n```javascript\nfunction ft_transfer(\n    receiver_id: string,\n    amount: string,\n    memo: string|null\n): void {}\n```\n\n#### 2. `ft_transfer_call`\n\nThis method extends the transfer functionality by allowing the caller to transfer tokens and invoke a method on the receiving contract simultaneously.\n\n- **Requirements**: Similar to `ft_transfer`, but also requires the receiving contract to implement `ft_on_transfer`.\n\n- **Arguments**:\n  - `receiver_id`: The recipient's NEAR account ID.\n  - `amount`: The token quantity to transfer, represented as a string.\n  - `memo`: An optional field.\n  - `msg`: Additional information for the receiving contract.\n\n```javascript\nfunction ft_transfer_call(\n   receiver_id: string,\n   amount: string,\n   memo: string|null,\n   msg: string\n): Promise {}\n```\n\n#### 3. `ft_on_transfer`\n\nThis function must be implemented by the receiving contract and is called by the Fungible Token contract during `ft_transfer_call`.\n\n- **Arguments**:\n  - `sender_id`: The account ID of the sender.\n  - `amount`: The token quantity transferred.\n  - `msg`: Information necessary for processing the transfer.\n\n- **Returns**: The number of unused tokens as a string.\n\n```javascript\nfunction ft_on_transfer(\n    sender_id: string,\n    amount: string,\n    msg: string\n): string {}\n```\n\n#### 4. View Methods\n\nThe interface also includes methods for querying token information:\n\n- **`ft_total_supply`**: Returns the total supply of tokens as a string.\n\n```javascript\nfunction ft_total_supply(): string {}\n```\n\n- **`ft_balance_of`**: Returns the balance of a specified account, defaulting to `\"0\"` if the account does not exist.\n\n```javascript\nfunction ft_balance_of(\n    account_id: string\n): string {}\n```\n\n### `ft_resolve_transfer`\n\nThe comment block at the end outlines the process flow for `ft_transfer_call`, detailing how the transfer and subsequent contract call should be handled. The steps ensure that if the cross-contract call fails, the token transfer will be rolled back to maintain the consistency of the state.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOverall, this code snippet establishes a robust framework for fungible tokens on the NEAR Protocol. By using strings for amounts, leveraging modular standards for storage management, and ensuring security through access key management, it creates a flexible and secure approach for token transfers and interactions within the NEAR ecosystem."}]}

This configuration defines various operational costs in terms of \"Gas\" for different actions taken by smart contracts on the NEAR blockchain. Gas is a unit that measures the amount of computational effort required to execute operations or transactions on the blockchain. Each operation has an associated gas cost, which helps ensure that users pay for the resources they consume.\n\n### Breakdown of the Document:\n\n1. **Base Structure**:\n   - The document is structured with headings that categorize different types of costs, such as memory operations, register operations, UTF-8/UTF-16 decoding, hashing functions, storage API operations, and promise API operations.\n\n2. **Cost Categories**:\n   - **Base Costs**: Each section starts with a base cost for a specific operation. For example, `read_memory_base` indicates the base cost for reading from guest memory.\n   - **Per-Byte Costs**: Many operations also have a cost associated with each byte processed. For example, `read_memory_byte` specifies the cost for reading each byte from memory.\n\n3. **Memory Operations**:\n   - Costs related to reading and writing memory are outlined, with separate base costs and per-byte costs for both read and write operations.\n\n4. **Register Operations**:\n   - Similar to memory operations, costs for reading from and writing to registers are defined. This includes both base costs and per-byte costs.\n\n5. **Encoding Costs**:\n   - The document includes costs associated with UTF-8 and UTF-16 decoding, which are important for handling string data in smart contracts.\n\n6. **Hashing Costs**:\n   - Costs for various hashing algorithms like SHA256 and Keccak are specified, both for base operations and per byte processed.\n\n7. **Logging Costs**:\n   - Costs for logging actions are included, which can be useful for debugging and tracking state changes in smart contracts.\n\n8. **Storage API Costs**:\n   - A comprehensive section detailing the costs associated with various storage operations, such as writing, reading, removing, and checking the existence of keys in the storage trie. \n   - Each storage operation has a base cost and additional costs per byte, which reflects the resource consumption based on the size of the data handled.\n\n9. **Promise API Costs**:\n   - Costs associated with promise-related operations are specified. Promises in NEAR allow for asynchronous execution of smart contract functions.\n\n### Example Cost Definitions:\n\n- **Memory Read Example**:\n    ```markdown\n    ## read_memory_base\n    _type: Gas_\n    \n    Base cost for guest memory read\n    ```\n    This indicates that when a smart contract reads from memory, there is a fixed base cost incurred, which is measured in Gas.\n\n- **Storage Write Example**:\n    ```markdown\n    ### storage_write_base\n    _type: Gas_\n    \n    Storage trie write key base cost\n    ```\n    This means there is a base gas cost associated with writing a key to the storage trie in NEAR.\n\n### Purpose of ExtCostsConfig\n\nThe `ExtCostsConfig` serves several purposes:\n\n- **Resource Management**: By assigning gas costs to operations, the NEAR Protocol can manage resources effectively, ensuring that users pay for the computational power they use.\n\n- **Incentivization**: Setting appropriate gas costs incentivizes developers to write efficient code and manage their resource usage smartly.\n\n- **Predictability**: Developers can estimate the costs associated with their smart contracts, leading to better planning and budgeting for transactions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, this document is a critical part of the NEAR Protocol's architecture, as it lays out the gas costs associated with various operations that smart contracts may perform. This cost structure helps maintain the efficiency and scalability of the blockchain by ensuring that users are charged appropriately for their resource consumption."}]}

Here, we will be going through the NFT contract and how we can test it with `near-workspaces-rs`.\n\n### Setup -- Imports\n\nFirst, we need to declare some imports for convenience.\n\n```rust\n// macro allowing us to convert args into JSON bytes to be read by the contract.\nuse serde_json::json;\n```\n\nWe will need to have our pre-compiled WASM contract ahead of time and know its path. Refer to the respective near-sdk-{rs, js} repos/language for where these paths are located.\n\nIn this showcase, we will be pointing to the example's NFT contract:\n\n```rust\nconst NFT_WASM_FILEPATH: &str = \"./examples/res/non_fungible_token.wasm\";\n```\n\nNOTE: there is an unstable feature that will allow us to compile our projects during testing time as well. Take a look at the feature section [Compiling Contracts During Test Time](#compiling-contracts-during-test-time)\n\n### Setup -- Setting up Sandbox and Deploying NFT Contract\n\nThis includes launching our sandbox, loading our wasm file and deploying that wasm file to the sandbox environment.\n\n```rust\n\n#[tokio::test]\nasync fn test_nft_contract() -> anyhow::Result<()> {\n    let worker = near_workspaces::sandbox().await?;\n    let wasm = std::fs::read(NFT_WASM_FILEPATH)?;\n    let contract = worker.dev_deploy(&wasm).await?;\n```\n\nWhere\n\n- `anyhow` - A crate that deals with error handling, making it more robust for developers.\n- `worker` - Our gateway towards interacting with our sandbox environment.\n- `contract`- The deployed contract on sandbox the developer interacts with.\n\n### Initialize Contract & Test Output\n\nThen we'll go directly into making a call into the contract, and initialize the NFT contract's metadata:\n\n```rust\n    let outcome = contract\n        .call(\"new_default_meta\")\n        .args_json(json!({\n            \"owner_id\": contract.id(),\n        }))\n        .transact()  // note: we use the contract's keys here to sign the transaction\n        .await?;\n\n    // outcome contains data like logs, receipts and transaction outcomes.\n    println!(\"new_default_meta outcome: {:#?}\", outcome);\n```\n\nAfterwards, let's mint an NFT via `nft_mint`. This showcases some extra arguments we can supply, such as deposit and gas:\n\n```rust\n    use near_gas::NearGas;\n    use near_workspaces::types::NearToken;\n\n    let deposit = NearToken::from_near(100);\n    let outcome = contract\n        .call(\"nft_mint\")\n        .args_json(json!({\n            \"token_id\": \"0\",\n            \"token_owner_id\": contract.id(),\n            \"token_metadata\": {\n                \"title\": \"Olympus Mons\",\n                \"description\": \"Tallest mountain in charted solar system\",\n                \"copies\": 1,\n            },\n        }))\n        .deposit(deposit)\n        // nft_mint might consume more than default gas, so supply our own gas value:\n        .gas(NearGas::```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The provided code snippet is a section from the `README.md` file of the NEAR Workspaces (Rust Edition) library, which is designed for automating workflows and writing tests for NEAR smart contracts. Below is a detailed breakdown of each part of the snippet, focusing on its purpose, functionality, and context within the NEAR ecosystem.\n\n### Overview of the Code Snippet\n\n1. **Title and Description**:\n   ```html\n   <h1>NEAR Workspaces (Rust Edition)</h1>\n   <p>\n     <strong>Rust library for automating workflows and writing tests for NEAR smart contracts. This software is not final, and will likely change.</strong>\n   </p>\n   ```\n   - This section introduces the `NEAR Workspaces` library specifically for Rust, emphasizing its purpose in automating workflows and testing smart contracts. It also notes that the library is still in development and may undergo changes.\n\n2. **Badges**:\n   ```html\n   <p>\n     <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/near-workspaces\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/crates/v/near-workspaces.svg?style=flat-square\" alt=\"Crates.io version\" /></a>\n     <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/near-workspaces\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/crates/d/near-workspaces.svg?style=flat-square\" alt=\"Download\" /></a>\n     <a href=\"https://docs.rs/near-workspaces\"><img src=\"https://docs.rs/near-workspaces/badge.svg\" alt=\"Reference Documentation\" /></a>\n   </p>\n   ```\n   - This section contains links to the library's version, download statistics, and reference documentation on `crates.io` and `docs.rs`, which are vital for developers seeking to use or learn more about the library.\n\n3. **Release Notes**:\n   ```markdown\n   ## Release notes\n\n   **Release notes and unreleased changes can be found in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)**\n   ```\n   - This indicates where to find detailed information about the library's version history and updates.\n\n4. **Requirements**:\n   ```markdown\n   ## Requirements\n\n   - Rust v1.69.0 and up.\n   - MacOS (x86 and M1) or Linux (x86) for sandbox tests.\n   ```\n   - It specifies the minimum Rust version required and the operating systems compatible with the library, which is crucial for developers to know before attempting to use it.\n\n5. **WASM Compilation**:\n   ```markdown\n   ### WASM compilation not supported\n\n   `near-workspaces-rs`, the library itself, does not currently compile to WASM. Best to put this dependency in `[dev-dependencies]` section of `Cargo.toml`...\n   ```\n   - Here, it is clarified that the library does not support compilation to WebAssembly (WASM) directly. Developers should include it in the `dev-dependencies` section of their `Cargo.toml` file if they are working with other WASM-compatible libraries.\n\n6. **Testing Example**:\n   - The code illustrates a simple test case for an NFT contract using the `near-workspaces` framework, which is essential for developers looking to understand how to implement tests for their smart contracts.\n\n### Code Walkthrough\n\n- **Imports**:\n   ```rust\n   use serde_json::json;\n   ```\n   - This import statement includes the `serde_json` crate, which allows converting Rust data structures into JSON format. This is particularly useful for preparing arguments for smart contract calls.\n\n- **WASM File Path**:\n   ```rust\n   const NFT_WASM_FILEPATH: &str = \"./examples/res/non_fungible_token.wasm\";\n   ```\n   - This constant defines the path to the pre-compiled WASM file for the NFT contract, which is necessary for deploying the contract in the sandbox.\n\n- **Setting Up Sandbox and Deploying Contract**:\n   ```rust\n   #[tokio::test]\n   async fn test_nft_contract() -> anyhow::Result<()> {\n       let worker = near_workspaces::sandbox().await?;\n       let wasm = std::fs::read(NFT_WASM_FILEPATH)?;\n       let contract = worker.dev_deploy(&wasm).await?;\n   ```\n   - The `#[tokio::test]` attribute indicates that this is an asynchronous test function. A sandbox environment is created for testing, and the NFT contract is deployed from the specified WASM file.\n\n- **Interacting with the Contract**:\n   ```rust\n   let outcome = contract\n       .call(\"new_default_meta\")\n       .args_json(json!({\n           \"owner_id\": contract.id(),\n       }))\n       .transact()\n       .await?;\n   ```\n   - This part makes a call to the `new_default_meta` function of the deployed NFT contract, passing the owner's ID as a JSON argument. The result (`outcome`) contains details about the transaction, such as logs and receipts.\n\n- **Minting an NFT**:\n   ```rust\n   use near_gas::NearGas;\n   use near_workspaces::types::NearToken;\n\n   let deposit = NearToken::from_near(100);\n   let outcome = contract\n       .call(\"nft_mint\")\n       .args_json(json!({\n           \"token_id\": \"0\",\n           \"token_owner_id\": contract.id(),\n           \"token_metadata\": {\n               \"title\": \"Olympus Mons\",\n               \"description\": \"Tallest mountain in charted solar system\",\n               \"copies\": 1,\n           },\n       }))\n       .deposit(deposit)\n       .gas(NearGas::...);\n   ```\n   - The code here demonstrates how to mint a new NFT by calling the `nft_mint` function. It specifies a deposit (in NEAR tokens) and provides additional metadata for the NFT being minted. The `gas` parameter is also set to ensure the function has enough resources to execute.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis code snippet provides a comprehensive overview of how to set up and test NEAR smart contracts using the `near-workspaces` library in Rust. It covers importing necessary libraries, configuring the environment, deploying contracts, and interacting with them through various function calls. Understanding this example is essential for developers looking to effectively utilize NEAR's capabilities for building and testing decentralized applications."}]}

snippet is a portion from the NEAR Protocol's `mpc-recovery` module, specifically from the `lib.rs` file. This code contains two asynchronous functions, `load_account_creator` and `load_entries`, as well as an implementation of a method `into_str_args` for a `Cli` enum. Below is a detailed explanation of each part of the code.\n\n### `load_account_creator` Function\n\n```rust\nasync fn load_account_creator(\n    gcp_service: &GcpService,\n    env: &str,\n    account_creator_id: &AccountId,\n    account_creator_sk: Vec<SecretKey>,\n) -> anyhow::Result<KeyRotatingSigner> {\n    let sks = if account_creator_sk.is_empty() {\n        let name = format!(\"mpc-recovery-account-creator-sk-{env}/versions/latest\");\n        let data = gcp_service.load_secret(name).await?;\n        serde_json::from_str(std::str::from_utf8(&data)?)?\n    } else {\n        account_creator_sk\n    };\n\n    Ok(KeyRotatingSigner::from_signers(sks.into_iter().map(|sk| {\n        InMemorySigner::from_secret_key(account_creator_id.clone(), sk)\n    })))\n}\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\n1. **Function Signature**: This function is asynchronous, which means it can perform non-blocking operations. It takes the following parameters:\n   - `gcp_service`: A reference to a `GcpService` instance to interact with Google Cloud Platform.\n   - `env`: A string slice representing the environment (e.g., \"test\", \"prod\").\n   - `account_creator_id`: An `AccountId` reference for the account creator.\n   - `account_creator_sk`: A vector of `SecretKey`s (private keys).\n\n2. **Secret Key Loading Logic**:\n   - If `account_creator_sk` is empty, it constructs a secret name based on the environment and fetches the secret from GCP using `gcp_service.load_secret`. This operation is awaited, meaning it will yield until the secret is loaded.\n   - The loaded secret data is then deserialized from JSON format into a vector of `SecretKey`s.\n\n3. **KeyRotatingSigner Creation**:\n   - Whether the keys are loaded from GCP or passed directly, the function then creates a `KeyRotatingSigner` by mapping each secret key to an `InMemorySigner`, which is initialized with the `account_creator_id`.\n\n4. **Return**: The function returns a `KeyRotatingSigner` wrapped in a `Result`, allowing for error handling using `anyhow::Result`.\n\n### `load_entries` Function\n\n```rust\nasync fn load_entries<T>(\n    gcp_service: &GcpService,\n    env: &str,\n    node_id: &str,\n    data: Option<String>,\n    path: Option<PathBuf>,\n) -> anyhow::Result<T>\nwhere\n    T: DeserializeOwned,\n{\n    let entries = match (data, path) {\n        (Some(data), None) => serde_json::from_str(&data)?,\n        (None, Some(path)) => {\n            let file = std::fs::File::open(path)?;\n            let reader = std::io::BufReader::new(file);\n            serde_json::from_reader(reader)?\n        }\n        (None, None) => {\n            let name =\n                format!(\"mpc-recovery-allowed-oidc-providers-{node_id}-{env}/versions/latest\");\n            let data = gcp_service.load_secret(name).await?;\n            serde_json::from_str(std::str::from_utf8(&data)?)?\n        }\n        _ => return Err(anyhow::anyhow!(\"Invalid combination of data and path\")),\n    };\n\n    Ok(entries)\n}\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\n1. **Generic Function**: This is an asynchronous function that is generic over type `T`, where `T` must implement the `DeserializeOwned` trait from Serde, allowing it to deserialize JSON data into the specified type.\n\n2. **Parameters**:\n   - Similar to `load_account_creator`, it accepts a `gcp_service`, `env`, `node_id`, and two optional parameters `data` (string) and `path` (file path).\n\n3. **Data Loading Logic**:\n   - The function uses pattern matching on `data` and `path` to determine where to source the entries from:\n     - If `data` is provided and `path` is `None`, it deserializes the JSON string directly.\n     - If `path` is provided, it reads the file and deserializes the JSON content.\n     - If both are `None`, it fetches the secret from GCP similar to the first function, based on `node_id` and `env`.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: If both `data` and `path` are `Some`, it returns an error indicating an invalid combination.\n\n5. **Return**: It returns the deserialized entries wrapped in a `Result`.\n\n### `Cli::into_str_args` Method\n\n```rust\nimpl Cli {\n    pub fn into_str_args(self) -> Vec<String> {\n        match self {\n            Cli::Generate { n } => {\n                vec![\"generate\".to_string(), n.to_string()]\n            }\n            Cli::StartLeader { ... } => {\n                let mut buf = vec![\n                    \"start-leader\".to_string(),\n                    \"--env\".to_string(),\n                    env.to_string(),\n                    \"--web-port\".to_string(),\n                    web_port.to_string(),\n                    ...\n                ];\n                // Additional arguments are pushed based on the provided fields\n                buf\n            }\n            Cli::StartSign { ... } => {\n                let mut buf = vec![\n                    \"start-sign\".to_string(),\n                    \"--env\".to_string(),\n                    env.to_string(),\n                    ...\n                ];\n                // Additional arguments are pushed based on the provided fields\n                buf\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\n1. **Enum Implementation**: This method is implemented for a `Cli` enum type, which likely represents different command-line interface commands.\n\n2. **Match Statement**: Depending on the variant of `Cli` (e.g., `Generate`, `StartLeader`, `StartSign`), it constructs a vector of strings that represent command-line arguments.\n\n3. **Arguments Construction**:\n   - For each variant, it initializes a vector and pushes command identifiers and options based on the fields provided in the variant.\n   - The method ensures that all necessary command-line arguments are collected into a single vector, which can then be used to execute commands.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, the provided code snippet contains functionality for loading account-related secrets from GCP and deserializing configuration entries, as well as constructing command-line arguments for various CLI commands.

Below is a detailed explanation of the key points covered in the code and its comments.\n\n### Overview\n\nThe module documentation explains that collections and types in this module provide scalable alternatives to standard Rust collections (`std::collections`) for use in smart contract state management. The primary focus is on how these collections handle data storage in a way that is optimized for blockchain environments where reading and writing data can be expensive.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n1. **Key/Value Store**:\n   - The fundamental storage structure in NEAR is a key/value store where both keys and values are represented as `Vec<u8>`. This means that any structured data (like `Vec<Account>`) has to be serialized into bytes for storage.\n\n2. **Lazy Loading**:\n   - The collections allow for \"lazy loading\" of data, meaning that only the specific elements that are interacted with are loaded into memory. This is a significant optimization, especially for large datasets, as it prevents the overhead of loading all values at once.\n\n3. **Data Access**:\n   - The module emphasizes the inefficiency of loading entire data structures for operations on single elements. Instead, collections like `store::Vector` are designed to be stored as multiple key-value pairs, allowing for efficient access to individual elements.\n\n4. **Serialization**:\n   - The collections do not implement the `serde::Serialize` and `serde::Deserialize` traits intentionally to avoid the costly operation of serializing/deserializing entire collections. Instead, they use `BorshSerialize` and `BorshDeserialize`, which are designed for efficient binary serialization in the NEAR ecosystem.\n\n5. **Collection Types**:\n   - The module defines several types of collections:\n     - **Sequences**: `Vector` acts like a contiguous array but is stored non-contiguously in the blockchain.\n     - **Maps**: \n       - `LookupMap`: A key-value store where keys are not persisted and cannot be iterated over.\n       - `UnorderedMap`: A non-ordered version similar to a hash map.\n       - `TreeMap`: An ordered map (unstable feature) that allows for key-based ordering.\n     - **Sets**:\n       - `LookupSet`: A non-iterable version of a hash set.\n       - `UnorderedSet`: An iterable version of a hash set persisted to storage.\n     - **Basic Types**:\n       - `Lazy<T>` and `LazyOption<T>`: Lazy-loaded types that only load data when accessed and persist data upon dropping.\n\n### Error Constants\n\nAt the end of the snippet, there are constants defined for common errors:\n- `ERR_INCONSISTENT_STATE`: This error indicates that a collection might be in a corrupted state due to unexpected termination of a previous smart contract execution.\n- `ERR_NOT_EXIST`: This error is raised when a key does not exist in a map.\n\n### Code Structure\nThe module also organizes the collection types into separate files, which are imported (`pub use`) into the current scope for easier accessibility. The `#[cfg(feature = \"unstable\")]` attributes indicate that certain features (like `Lazy` and `TreeMap`) are only available when the unstable feature flag is enabled.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis code snippet provides essential functionality for managing storage in smart contracts on the NEAR Protocol. By using custom collections optimized for the blockchain environment, developers can efficiently handle state management while keeping performance and scalability in mind. The lazy loading mechanism and the choice of serialization format are particularly significant for ensuring that contracts operate efficiently within the constraints of a blockchain."}]}

Here’s a detailed explanation of each part of the snippet:\n\n### Deploying the Fungible Token Contract\n\nThe first command deploys the fungible token contract (`$TRANSFER_FT_CONTRACT_ID`) with an initialization call that sets the initial metadata and total supply of the tokens.\n\n```bash\ncargo near deploy $TRANSFER_FT_CONTRACT_ID with-init-call new_default_meta json-args '{\"owner_id\": \"'$TRANSFER_FT_CONTRACT_ID'\", \"total_supply\": \"1000000000000000000000000000\"}' prepaid-gas '100.0 Tgas' attached-deposit '0 NEAR' network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send\n```\n\n**Breakdown of the command:**\n- `cargo near deploy`: Command to deploy the contract using NEAR CLI.\n- `$TRANSFER_FT_CONTRACT_ID`: This variable holds the contract ID where the FT will be deployed.\n- `with-init-call new_default_meta`: Specifies that the `new_default_meta` function will be called during the deployment.\n- `json-args '{\"owner_id\": \"'$TRANSFER_FT_CONTRACT_ID'\", \"total_supply\": \"1000000000000000000000000000\"}'`: Initializes the contract with the `owner_id` set to the contract ID and `total_supply` set to a specified amount (1 billion tokens here, represented in yoctoNEAR).\n- `prepaid-gas '100.0 Tgas'`: Specifies the amount of gas to be prepaid for the transaction.\n- `attached-deposit '0 NEAR'`: No NEAR deposit is required for the initialization.\n- `network-config testnet`: Specifies that the deployment will occur on the NEAR testnet.\n- `sign-with-keychain send`: Uses the local NEAR wallet (keychain) for signing the transaction.\n\n### Checking Token Ownership\n\nAfter deploying the token, you can check the balance of the fungible tokens owned by the contract account using the following commands:\n\n```bash\nnear view $TRANSFER_FT_CONTRACT_ID ft_balance_of '{\"account_id\": \"'$TRANSFER_FT_CONTRACT_ID'\"}' --networkId testnet\n```\n\nThis command:\n- Uses `near view` to call a read-only method of the contract.\n- `ft_balance_of`: Method to check the balance of a specified account.\n- `json-args '{\"account_id\": \"'$TRANSFER_FT_CONTRACT_ID'\"}'`: Passes the account ID as an argument to check its balance.\n\n### Testing the Transfer Function\n\nThe next steps involve transferring tokens from the owner account to another account (`benjiman.testnet`):\n\n#### Registering the Account\n\nBefore transferring tokens, `benjiman.testnet` needs to register with the contract:\n\n```bash\nnear call $TRANSFER_FT_CONTRACT_ID storage_deposit '{\"account_id\": \"benjiman.testnet\"}' --gas 100000000000000 --deposit 0.01 --accountId $TRANSFER_FT_CONTRACT_ID --networkId testnet\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `near call`: Calls a method on the contract.\n- `storage_deposit`: This method is used to register an account to allow it to hold fungible tokens.\n- `--deposit 0.01`: This specifies the amount of NEAR to be attached to cover storage costs.\n\n#### Transferring Tokens\n\nAfter the account is registered, you can transfer tokens:\n\n```bash\nnear call $TRANSFER_FT_CONTRACT_ID ft_transfer '{\"receiver_id\": \"benjiman.testnet\", \"amount\": \"1000000000000000000000000\", \"memo\": \"Go Team :)\"}' --gas 100000000000000 --depositYocto 1 --accountId $TRANSFER_FT_CONTRACT_ID --networkId testnet\n```\n\n**Key Parts of the Transfer Command:**\n- `ft_transfer`: Method for transferring tokens.\n- `receiver_id`: Specifies the recipient of the tokens.\n- `amount`: The amount of tokens to transfer (in yoctoNEAR).\n- `memo`: An optional message accompanying the transfer.\n- `--depositYocto 1`: A minimal deposit of 1 yoctoNEAR is required for the transaction to proceed.\n\n### Final Checks\n\nFinally, you can check the balances of both the sender and receiver accounts to ensure the transfer occurred as expected. The total supply should remain unchanged, but the balances should reflect the transfer:\n\n```bash\nnear view $TRANSFER_FT_CONTRACT_ID ft_balance_of '{\"account_id\": \"'$TRANSFER_FT_CONTRACT_ID'\"}' --networkId testnet\n```\n\nThis command can be run similarly for both the sender and receiver to confirm the balances post-transfer.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis snippet demonstrates the process of:\n1. Deploying a fungible token contract with an initial supply.\n2. Registering an account to hold tokens.\n3. Transferring tokens between accounts.\n4. Verifying balances to confirm the correctness of operations.\n\nUnderstanding these steps is crucial for anyone looking to work with fungible tokens on the NEAR Protocol."}]}

It derives the `Debug` and `Clone` traits, meaning instances of this struct can be printed for debugging and duplicated.\n\n3. **Implementation of DisplayContext**:\n   ```rust\n   impl DisplayContext {\n       pub fn from_previous_context(\n           previous_context: super::SignLaterContext,\n           _scope: &<Display as interactive_clap::ToInteractiveClapContextScope>::InteractiveClapContextScope,\n       ) -> color_eyre::eyre::Result<Self> {\n   ```\n   - The `from_previous_context` function is defined for `DisplayContext`. This function takes two parameters:\n     - `previous_context`: An instance of `SignLaterContext` that contains information about an unsigned transaction.\n     - `_scope`: A context scope that is specific to the `Display` struct (though it is not used in the implementation, indicated by the underscore).\n\n4. **Displaying Transaction Information**:\n   ```rust\n       eprintln!(\n           \"\\nTransaction hash to sign:\\n{}\",\n           hex::encode(previous_context.unsigned_transaction.get_hash_and_size().0)\n       );\n   ```\n   - This line prints the transaction hash to the standard error output (using `eprintln!`).\n   - It retrieves the hash of the unsigned transaction from `previous_context` and encodes it in hexadecimal format using `hex::encode`.\n\n5. **Showing Serialized Transaction**:\n   ```rust\n       eprintln!(\n           \"\\nUnsigned transaction (serialized as base64):\\n{}\\n\",\n           crate::types::transaction::TransactionAsBase64::from(\n               previous_context.unsigned_transaction\n           )\n       );\n   ```\n   - This line prints the unsigned transaction serialized as a Base64 string.\n   - It utilizes a conversion from `previous_context.unsigned_transaction` to a `TransactionAsBase64` type, which presumably provides a Base64 representation of the transaction.\n\n6. **Helper Command Information**:\n   ```rust\n       eprintln!(\n           \"This base64-encoded transaction can be signed and sent later. There is a helper command on near CLI that can do that:\\n$ {} transaction sign-transaction\\n\",\n           crate::common::get_near_exec_path()\n       );\n   ```\n   - This line informs the user about a command they can use to sign the transaction later via the NEAR CLI (Command Line Interface).\n   - It calls `get_near_exec_path()` to get the executable path for the NEAR CLI.\n\n7. **Result Return**:\n   ```rust\n       Ok(Self)\n   }\n   ```\n   - The function returns an `Ok` result containing an instance of `DisplayContext`. This indicates successful processing and allows for graceful error handling using the `color_eyre` library.\n\n### Summary\n\nOverall, this code snippet is part of an interactive command-line interface for the NEAR Protocol, designed to display transaction details to the user before they sign the transaction. It effectively uses Rust's type system and error handling to ensure that the information about transactions is presented in a user-friendly manner while also providing guidance on how to proceed with signing the transaction later."}]}

The string does not contain any executable code or direct logic that can be analyzed in a conventional programming sense. Instead, it is likely used to store or transmit graphical assets.\n\n### Breakdown of the Code Snippet\n\n1. **Base64 Encoding**: The string is a long sequence of characters that includes letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and symbols (`+`, `/`, `=`). This format is commonly used to encode binary data into text format. In this specific context, it is likely representing an image file, which can be decoded back to its original binary form.\n\n2. **Usage Scenario**: \n   - In a wallet application, this encoded string may represent a logo or icon that is displayed in the user interface.\n   - It allows for easy embedding of images in code or transmission over channels that may not support binary data directly.\n\n3. **Decoding the String**: To understand what this string represents, you can decode it from Base64 to see the original binary data. Here’s how you can do that in JavaScript:\n\n   ```javascript\n   const base64String = \"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\";\n\n   // Decode Base64 string\n   const binaryData = Buffer.from(base64String, 'base64');\n\n   // Optionally, you can convert it to a Blob or an image element if needed\n   const blob = new Blob([binaryData], { type: 'image/png' }); // Assuming it's a PNG image\n   const imageUrl = URL.createObjectURL(blob);\n   console.log(imageUrl); // You can use this URL in an <img> tag\n   ```\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The provided string is a Base64-encoded representation of some binary data, possibly an icon or image used in the NEAR wallet. To understand its exact nature or to see it visually, decoding it is necessary. The example above demonstrates how to decode and utilize the data in a JavaScript context, which is commonly used in web applications."}]}

appears to be a Markdown document from the NEAR Protocol's documentation, specifically focused on common use cases for the `near-api-js` library. This library allows developers to interact with the NEAR blockchain using JavaScript. Let's break down the key components of the snippet:\n\n### Structure of the Document\n\n1. **Front Matter**:\n   ```markdown\n   ---\n   id: cookbook\n   title: Common Use Cases\n   sidebar_label: Cookbook\n   ---\n   ```\n   - This section defines metadata for the document. \n   - `id`: A unique identifier for the document, which can be used in links.\n   - `title`: The displayed title for the document.\n   - `sidebar_label`: The label used in the sidebar navigation.\n\n2. **Imports**:\n   ```javascript\n   import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';\n   import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';\n   ```\n   - These lines import components from a theme package, likely used for rendering tabbed content in the documentation.\n\n### Content Overview\n\nThe main content of the document outlines various \"recipes\" (code examples) that illustrate common scenarios developers may encounter while working with the NEAR blockchain. This is structured as a table with two columns: **Name** and **Description**.\n\n### Table Breakdown\n\n- **ACCOUNTS**: This section includes recipes related to account management.\n  - **Create Account**: Guides users on creating NEAR accounts directly, bypassing the NEAR Wallet.\n  - **Access Key Rotation**: Provides instructions on how to create and delete access keys, enhancing account security.\n\n- **TRANSACTIONS**: This section contains recipes focused on managing transactions.\n  - **Get Transaction Status**: Shows how to retrieve the status of a transaction using its hash.\n  - **Recent Transaction Details**: Explains how to get details of recent transactions without relying on external indexing services.\n  - **Batch Transactions**: Demonstrates how to sign and send several transactions simultaneously.\n\n- **UTILS**: This section offers utility functions that aid in various operations.\n  - **Deploy Contract**: Instructions for deploying a smart contract using a pre-compiled WebAssembly (WASM) file.\n  - **Calculate Gas**: A method for calculating the gas consumption from contract calls.\n  - **Read State w/o Account**: Allows reading contract state without the need for an account instance.\n  - **Wrap/Unwrap**: Functions for wrapping and unwrapping NEAR tokens using the `wrap.near` smart contract.\n  - **Verify Signature**: A utility to verify the signature of a key pair.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis Markdown snippet serves as a concise reference guide for developers utilizing the `near-api-js` library. Each recipe is linked to its respective code example on GitHub, providing a quick way to access practical implementations for common tasks in NEAR development. This structure is beneficial for fostering rapid development by allowing users to directly access and implement proven solutions. \n\n### Example Usage\n\nIf a developer wanted to create a new account without using NEAR Wallet, they would simply follow the link provided under the \"Create Account\" recipe, which leads to the relevant code snippet. This approach encourages best practices and enhances the overall developer experience within the NEAR ecosystem."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain the following code snippet from NEAR repository file `docs/3.tutorials/nfts/js/5-approval.md`:\n``` (which we'll implement soon). This is both for security and to cover storage. When someone approves an account ID, they're storing that information on the contract. As you saw in the [minting tutorial](/tutorials/nfts/js/minting), you can either have the smart contract account cover the storage, or you can have the users cover that cost. The latter is more scalable and it's the approach you'll be working with throughout this tutorial.\n\nAfter the assertion comes back with no problems, you get the token object and make sure that only the owner is calling this method. Only the owner should be able to allow other accounts to transfer their NFTs. You then get the next approval ID and insert the passed in account into the map with the next approval ID. If it's a new approval ID, storage must be paid. If it's not a new approval ID, no storage needs to be paid and only attaching 1 yoctoNEAR would be enough.\n\nYou then calculate how much storage is being used by adding that new account to the map and increment the tokens `next_approval_id` by 1. After inserting the token object back into the `tokensById` map, you refund any excess storage.\n\nYou'll notice that the function contains an optional `msg` parameter. This message is actually the foundation of all NFT marketplaces on NEAR.\n\n#### Marketplace Integrations {#marketplace-integrations}\n\nIf a message was provided into the function, you're going to perform a cross contract call to the account being given access. This cross contract call will invoke the `nft_on_approve` function which will parse the message and act accordingly. Let's consider a general use case.\n\nWe have a marketplace that expects it's sale conditions to be passed in through the message field. Benji approves the marketplace with the `nft_approve` function and passes in a stringified JSON to the message which will outline sale conditions. These sale conditions could look something like the following:\n\n```json\nsale_conditions: {\n    price: 5\n}\n```\n\nBy leaving the message field type as just a string, this generalizes the process and allows users to input sale conditions for many different marketplaces. It is up to the person approving to pass in an appropriate message that the marketplace can properly decode and use. This is usually done through the marketplace's frontend app which would know how to construct the `msg` in a useful way.\n\n#### Internal functions\n\nNow that the core logic for approving an account is finished, you need to implement the `assertAtLeastOneYocto` and `bytesForApprovedAccountId` functions. Move to the `nft-contract/src/internal.ts` file and copy the following function right below the `assertOneYocto` function.\n\n<Github language=\"js\" start=\"61\" end=\"64\" url=\"https://github.com/near-examples/nft-tutorial-js/blob/5.approval/src/nft-contract/internal.ts\" />\n\nNext, you'll need to copy the logic for calculating how many bytes it costs to store an account ID. Place this function at the very top of the page:\n\n<Github language=\"js\" start=\"55\" end=\"59\" url=\"https://github.com/near-examples/nft-tutorial-js/blob/5.approval/src/nft-contract/internal.ts\" />\n\nNow that the logic for approving accounts is finished, you need to change the restrictions for transferring.\n\n### Changing the restrictions for transferring NFTs\n\nCurrently, an NFT can **only** be transferred by its owner. You need to change that restriction so that people that have been approved can also transfer NFTs. In addition, you'll make it so that if an approval ID is passed, you can increase the security and check if both the account trying to transfer is in the approved list **and** they correspond to the correct approval ID. This is to address the problem we ran into earlier.\n\nIn the `internal.ts` file, you need to change the logic of the `internalTransfer` method as that's where the restrictions are being made. Change the internal transfer function to be the following:\n\n<Github language=\"js\" start=\"108\" end=\"163\" url=\"https://github.com/near-examples/nft-tutorial-js/blob/5.approval/src/nft-contract/internal.ts\" />\n\nThis will check if the sender isn't the owner and then if they're not, it will check if the sender is in the approval list. If an approval ID was passed into the function, it will check if the sender's actual approval ID stored on the contract matches the one passed in.\n\n#### Refunding storage on transfer\n\nWhile you're in the internal file, you're going to need to add methods for refunding users who have paid for storing approved accounts on the contract when an NFT is transferred.```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The provided code snippet is from a NEAR Protocol tutorial focused on implementing the approval mechanism for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). The approval mechanism allows an NFT owner to grant another account permission to transfer their NFT. Here's a detailed breakdown of the key concepts discussed in the snippet:\n\n### Key Concepts Explained\n\n1. **Approval Mechanism**: \n   - When an account (the owner) approves another account to transfer their NFTs, this information is stored in the smart contract. This is crucial for security and storage management. The owner can set up which accounts can manage their NFTs.\n\n2. **Storage Costs**: \n   - In NEAR, every piece of data stored on the blockchain incurs a cost. The tutorial mentions two approaches:\n     - **Contract-covered storage**: The smart contract itself pays for the storage costs, which can be less scalable.\n     - **User-covered storage**: The user who is granting approval pays for the storage, which is more scalable.\n\n3. **Approval ID Management**:\n   - The approval mechanism uses an approval ID to track each approval instance. If a new account is approved, storage must be allocated. If the account was previously approved, a minimal amount (1 yoctoNEAR) is attached to the transaction to cover operational costs.\n\n4. **Refunding Excess Storage**:\n   - After processing the approval, if there are any excess storage fees paid by the user, the contract refunds them.\n\n5. **Optional Message Parameter**:\n   - The `msg` parameter allows the owner to pass additional information (like sale conditions) to the approved account. This is essential for NFT marketplaces where specific conditions for selling the NFT may need to be communicated.\n\n6. **Cross Contract Calls**:\n   - When an account is approved, a cross-contract call to the `nft_on_approve` function is made. This allows the approved account (e.g., a marketplace) to react to the approval and handle the provided message appropriately.\n\n7. **Changing Transfer Restrictions**:\n   - The code intends to modify the transfer logic so that approved accounts can also transfer NFTs, alongside the owner. If an approval ID is specified during the transfer, the contract checks if the sender is in the approved list and whether the approval ID matches.\n\n### Implementation Steps\n\nThe tutorial outlines several steps to implement this functionality:\n\n1. **Implement Internal Functions**:\n   - Functions such as `assertAtLeastOneYocto` and `bytesForApprovedAccountId` need to be implemented. These aid in validating transactions and calculating storage costs for account IDs.\n\n2. **Adjust Transfer Logic**:\n   - Update the `internalTransfer` function to include checks for approved accounts. This ensures security by validating both the approval status and the correct approval ID.\n\n3. **Refund Mechanism**:\n   - Implement methods to refund users for any storage costs incurred when their NFTs are transferred.\n\n### Code Snippet Example\n\nHere’s an example of how you might implement some of the discussed functions in TypeScript:\n\n```typescript\n// This function checks if at least one yoctoNEAR is attached to the transaction\nfunction assertAtLeastOneYocto() {\n    const attachedDeposit = context.attachedDeposit;\n    assert(attachedDeposit >= 1, \"Must attach at least one yoctoNEAR\");\n}\n\n// This function calculates the number of bytes required to store an account ID\nfunction bytesForApprovedAccountId(accountId: string): number {\n    return accountId.length + 4; // 4 bytes for the length prefix\n}\n\n// Example of modifying the internal transfer function\nfunction internalTransfer(sender: string, receiver: string, tokenId: string, approvalId?: number) {\n    // Check if sender is the owner or in the approved list\n    if (sender !== tokenOwner[tokenId] && !isApproved(sender, tokenId, approvalId)) {\n        throw new Error(\"Sender not authorized to transfer this token.\");\n    }\n\n    // Logic for transferring the token\n    // ...\n}\n\n// Check if the sender is approved for the token\nfunction isApproved(sender: string, tokenId: string, approvalId?: number): boolean {\n    const approvedId = approvals[tokenId][sender];\n    return approvedId !== undefined && (approvalId === undefined || approvedId === approvalId);\n}\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe approval mechanism for NFTs in NEAR is designed to balance security and scalability. By allowing users to manage their own approval costs and providing a flexible messaging system for marketplaces, the implementation can support various use cases. This tutorial guides developers through creating a robust approval system while ensuring that transaction costs and security are appropriately managed."}]}

Let's break it down step by step:\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n1. **Import Statement**:\n   ```typescript\n   import { SignMethod } from \"./types\";\n   ```\n   - This line imports the `SignMethod` type from a module located in the same directory (`./types`). The `SignMethod` type likely represents a union of string literals that define valid signing methods used in Ethereum transactions.\n\n2. **Function Declaration**:\n   ```typescript\n   export function isSignMethod(method: string): method is SignMethod {\n   ```\n   - Here, we define a function named `isSignMethod` that takes a single parameter `method` of type `string`.\n   - The return type of the function is a TypeScript type predicate (`method is SignMethod`). This means that if the function returns `true`, TypeScript will understand that the `method` variable is of type `SignMethod`. This is useful for type narrowing in TypeScript.\n\n3. **Method Checking**:\n   ```typescript\n   return [\n     \"eth_sign\",\n     \"personal_sign\",\n     \"eth_sendTransaction\",\n     \"eth_signTypedData\",\n     \"eth_signTypedData_v4\",\n   ].includes(method);\n   ```\n   - This line checks if the input `method` is one of the predefined valid signing methods. \n   - An array of valid methods is created, and the `includes` method is used to check if `method` exists within that array. \n   - If `method` is found in the array, `includes` returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe `isSignMethod` function is a type guard that helps ensure that a given string corresponds to one of the valid Ethereum signing methods. This is particularly useful in a TypeScript context where type safety is important, allowing developers to handle only the valid methods without worrying about runtime errors related to invalid method names.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nHere’s a brief example of how you might use the `isSignMethod` function:\n\n```typescript\nconst methodToCheck: string = \"eth_sign\";\n\nif (isSignMethod(methodToCheck)) {\n  // TypeScript now knows that methodToCheck is of type SignMethod\n  console.log(`${methodToCheck} is a valid sign method.`);\n} else {\n  console.log(`${methodToCheck} is not a valid sign method.`);\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, if `methodToCheck` is one of the valid methods, the program will log that it is a valid sign method; otherwise, it will log that it is not valid. This ensures that only confirmed valid methods are processed further in the application."}]}

Let's break down the important components of this snippet.\n\n### Overview\n\nThe command being documented allows users to query and list the access keys associated with a NEAR account. Access keys are essential for interacting with the NEAR blockchain, as they dictate what actions can be performed by various applications or accounts.\n\n### Key Components of the Snippet\n\n1. **Command Description**:\n    - The command `near account list-keys` is specifically designed to retrieve and display the access keys of a given account. The command can also examine keys as of the current state (`now`) or at a specific historical block height or hash.\n\n2. **Command Syntax**:\n    - The command syntax to list access keys is given as follows:\n    ```bash\n    near account list-keys fro_volod.testnet network-config testnet now\n    ```\n    - Here, `fro_volod.testnet` is the NEAR account whose keys are being queried.\n    - `network-config testnet` specifies that this command is being executed on the NEAR test network.\n    - `now` indicates that the current state of the account will be retrieved.\n\n3. **Example Output**:\n    - The output of the command provides a detailed list of access keys along with their properties:\n        - **Access Key Type**: All keys listed are of type `ed25519`, which is a common elliptic curve used for cryptographic security.\n        - **Nonce**: Each key has an associated nonce value, which is a counter that helps prevent replay attacks by ensuring that each transaction is unique.\n        - **Permissions**: The output specifies the level of access granted to each key:\n            - \"full access\" means the key can perform any operation on the account.\n            - Limited access (e.g., \"only do [] function calls on v2.ref-farming.testnet with an allowance of 0.25 NEAR\") restricts the key to specific functions or limits its financial capabilities.\n\n### Example Output Breakdown\n\nThe output shows a total of 14 access keys. Here's how to interpret a sample entry:\n```\n1. ed25519:2QFAeUutKUDpmgKDyHXm7Wcz1uhjxk92fK6zY2dB7FCD (nonce: 97492076000000) is granted to only do [] function calls on v2.ref-farming.testnet with an allowance of 0.25 NEAR\n```\n- **Key**: `ed25519:2QFA...` is the unique identifier for the access key.\n- **Nonce**: `97492076000000` indicates the key's transaction nonce.\n- **Permissions**: The key is restricted to specific function calls on `v2.ref-farming.testnet` and has a financial allowance set at 0.25 NEAR.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis documentation snippet is crucial for developers and users interacting with the NEAR blockchain, as it provides a clear command for checking the access keys of an account. Understanding the access keys and their permissions is vital for ensuring proper security and functionality when developing or using dApps on the NEAR platform."}]}

These functions likely handle user authentication and key verification processes.\n\n### Summary\n\nOverall, this code snippet demonstrates how to make a JSON-RPC call to the NEAR blockchain to query information regarding an access key for a given account. It sets up the request, processes the response, and returns a value that is presumably related to user authentication or access management. The surrounding module structure suggests that this is part of a larger application focused on user authentication in the NEAR ecosystem."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain the following code snippet from NEAR repository file `docs/1.concepts/web3/near.md`:\n```, careful choice of data structures is very important. Moving to a different data structure later will not be easy and would probably require data migration.\n- While very useful, vectors, maps and sets won’t match the flexibility and power of classical relational databases. Even implementations of simple filtering and searching might be quite complex and require a lot of gas to execute, especially if multiple entities with relations between them are involved.\n- They are limited to a single contract. If data from multiple contracts is required, aggregation should be performed using cross-contract calls or on a client side, which is quite expensive in terms of gas and time.\n\nTo support more complex data retrieval scenarios, smart contract data should be put in a more appropriate store, like a relational database. Indexers are used to achieve this. In a nutshell, indexer is just a special kind of blockchain node that processes incoming transactions and puts relevant data into a database. Collected data can be exposed to a client using a simple API server (e.g. REST or GraphQL).\n\n\n![image](/docs/assets/web3/web3-15.png)\n    \n\n\nIn order to simplify creation of indexers, [NEAR Indexer Framework](/concepts/advanced/near-indexer-framework) has been created. However, even with a framework available, extracting data from a transaction may not be an easy task, since each smart contract has its unique structure and data storage model. To simplify this process, smart contracts can write structured information about outcome into the logs  (e.g. in the JSON format). Each smart contract can use its own format for such logs, but the general format has been standardized as [Events](https://nomicon.io/Standards/EventsFormat).\n\nSuch architecture is very similar to Event Sourcing, where blockchain stores events (transactions), and they are materialized to a relational database using an indexer. This means the same drawbacks also apply. For instance, a client should be designed to accommodate indexing delay, which may take a few seconds.\n\nAs an alternative to building your own indexer with a database and an API server, [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/) can be used instead, which currently has [NEAR support in beta](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/supported-networks/near/). It works using the Indexer-as-a-Service model, and even has decentralized indexing implementation.\n\n## Development tools\n\nBy now, we should be familiar with necessary concepts to start developing WEB 3.0 applications, so let’s explore the development tools available.\n\nFirst of all, we need a development and testing environment. Of course, we could theoretically perform development and testing on the main blockchain network, but this would not be cheap. For this reason, NEAR provides [several networks](../../1.concepts/basics/networks.md) that can be used during development:\n- testnet - public NEAR network which is identical to mainnet and can be used for free.\n- localnet - you can deploy your personal NEAR network on your own environment. Because it’s owned by you, data and code can be kept private during development. More info on how you can run your own node can be [found here](https://near-nodes.io/validator/running-a-node). Alternatively, you can bootstrap an entire testing infrastructure in Docker on your local machine using Kurtosis - [guide is here](../../2.build/2.smart-contracts/testing/kurtosis-localnet.md).\n- workspaces - you can start your own local network to perform e2e testing. More info [here](../../2.build/2.smart-contracts/testing/integration-test.md).\n\nOnce we’ve chosen a network to use, we need a way to interact with it. Of course, transactions can be constructed manually and posted into [node’s API](/api/rpc/setup). But [this is tedious](https://github.com/near-examples/transaction-examples) and isn’t fun at all. That’s why, NEAR [provides a CLI](../../4.tools/cli.md) which automates all of the necessary actions. It can be used locally for development purposes or on build machines for CI/CD scenarios.\n\nIn order to manage accounts on the NEAR network, [Wallet](https://wiki.near.org/overview/tokenomics/creating-a-near-wallet) can be used. It can show an effective account balance and active keys.\n\n![image](/docs/assets/web3/web3-16.png)\n\n\nOn the image above, “Reserved for storage” are tokens locked by a smart contract to cover current storage requirements, and “Reserved for transactions” represents the amount of tokens locked to cover gas cost by Functional Call keys.\nCurrently, there’s no UI to connect sub-accounts into a wallet. Instead, they should be imported via a specially constructed direct link:\n```\nhttps://testnet.mynearwallet.com/auto-import-secret-key#YOUR_ACCOUNT```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The provided code snippet is a segment from the NEAR Protocol documentation, specifically discussing the challenges and strategies for managing data in smart contracts and the use of indexers to enhance data retrieval. Below is a detailed breakdown of the key points covered in the snippet:\n\n### Key Concepts Explained\n\n1. **Data Structures in Smart Contracts**:\n   - The snippet emphasizes the importance of selecting the right data structures when designing smart contracts. \n   - Changing data structures post-deployment can be complex and might necessitate data migration, which can be resource-intensive.\n\n2. **Limitations of Built-in Data Structures**:\n   - NEAR's built-in data structures (vectors, maps, and sets) may not offer the same capabilities as traditional relational databases. \n   - Implementing features like filtering and searching can be gas-expensive, especially when dealing with interconnected entities across contracts.\n\n3. **Cross-Contract Data Access**:\n   - Accessing data across multiple contracts requires aggregation, which can be achieved through cross-contract calls or client-side operations, both of which can incur high gas costs and latency.\n\n4. **Role of Indexers**:\n   - To facilitate complex data retrieval, it is recommended to use an external store, such as a relational database, in conjunction with indexers.\n   - An indexer is a specialized blockchain node that extracts relevant data from transactions and stores it in a database, allowing for efficient querying through an API (e.g., REST or GraphQL).\n\n5. **NEAR Indexer Framework**:\n   - The NEAR Indexer Framework simplifies the process of creating indexers, but extracting data from transactions can still be challenging due to the unique structure of each smart contract.\n   - Contracts can log structured information (in JSON format) about transactions, which can be standardized as Events, aiding in data retrieval.\n\n6. **Event Sourcing**:\n   - The architecture described resembles Event Sourcing, where the blockchain stores events (transactions), which are then materialized into a database via an indexer.\n   - Clients must handle potential indexing delays, which could range from seconds to longer periods.\n\n7. **Alternative Indexing Solutions**:\n   - Instead of building a custom indexer, developers can utilize third-party services like **The Graph**, which offers support for NEAR in beta. \n   - The Graph operates on an Indexer-as-a-Service model, providing decentralized indexing capabilities.\n\n### Development Tools Overview\n\n1. **Development and Testing Environments**:\n   - The documentation highlights the importance of using designated networks for development to avoid costs associated with the mainnet. \n   - **Testnet**, **Localnet**, and **Workspaces** are recommended environments:\n     - **Testnet**: A public NEAR network that mirrors the mainnet and is free to use.\n     - **Localnet**: A personal NEAR network that can be run locally, providing privacy during development.\n     - **Workspaces**: Allows for end-to-end testing on a local network.\n\n2. **Interaction with NEAR Networks**:\n   - Although transactions can be manually crafted and sent via the node's API, this approach is cumbersome. \n   - NEAR provides a Command-Line Interface (CLI) to automate transaction processes for easier development and integration.\n\n3. **Account Management**:\n   - The section also covers account management through the NEAR Wallet, which provides a user-friendly interface for managing account balances and keys.\n   - It explains how tokens are reserved for storage and transaction costs, and provides a way to import sub-accounts using a specific link format.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe snippet underscores the importance of thoughtful architecture in smart contract development on the NEAR Protocol, particularly regarding data management and retrieval. It also outlines development tools and methodologies that facilitate the creation of efficient, scalable dApps. Understanding these concepts is crucial for developers looking to leverage the NEAR ecosystem effectively."}]}

It is written in TypeScript and uses Jest as the testing framework. Below is a detailed breakdown of each part of the code to help you understand its functionality and structure.\n\n### Imports and Setup\n\n```typescript\n/* eslint-disable @nx/enforce-module-boundaries */\nimport { mock } from \"jest-mock-extended\";\nimport type { ProviderService } from \"packages/core/src/lib/services\";\nimport type { FinalExecutionOutcome } from \"near-api-js/lib/providers\";\n\nimport { setupOKXWallet } from \"./okx-wallet\";\nimport { mockWallet } from \"../../../core/src/lib/testUtils\";\nimport type { AccessKey, SignOutResponse } from \"./injected-okx-wallet\";\nimport type { InjectedWallet } from \"../../../core/src/lib/wallet\";\n```\n\n- **eslint-disable**: This comment disables a specific ESLint rule for module boundaries, allowing for more flexible imports in tests.\n- **Imports**: Essential modules and types such as `mock` from `jest-mock-extended`, `ProviderService`, and types from `near-api-js` are imported. Functions like `setupOKXWallet` and `mockWallet` are also imported for setting up the wallet and mocking respectively.\n\n### Constants and Jest Mocks\n\n```typescript\nconst accountId = \"test-account.testnet\";\nconst transactions = [\n  {\n    signerId: accountId,\n    receiverId: \"test.testnet\",\n    actions: [],\n  },\n];\n\njest.mock(\"near-api-js/lib/transaction\", () => {\n  return {\n    ...jest.requireActual(\"near-api-js/lib/transaction\"),\n    SignedTransaction: {\n      ...jest.requireActual(\"near-api-js/lib/transaction\").SignedTransaction,\n      decode: jest.fn().mockReturnValue({}),\n    },\n  };\n});\n```\n\n- **Constants**: `accountId` and `transactions` are defined for use in tests. `accountId` simulates a user account, while `transactions` holds transaction data.\n- **jest.mock**: This mock overrides the `SignedTransaction.decode` method to return an empty object. This prevents actual decoding logic from executing during tests, making them more isolated.\n\n### Mocking the OKX Wallet\n\n```typescript\nconst mockOkx = () => {\n  const okxwallet = {\n    near: {\n      getAccountId: jest.fn().mockReturnValue(\"\"),\n      requestSignIn: jest.fn(async () => {\n        window.okxwallet.near!.getAccountId = jest\n          .fn()\n          .mockReturnValue(accountId);\n\n        return {\n          accountId,\n          accessKey: mock<AccessKey>(),\n          error: \"\",\n        };\n      }),\n      signOut: jest.fn().mockReturnValue(mock<SignOutResponse>()),\n      isSignedIn: jest.fn().mockReturnValue(true),\n      on: jest.fn(),\n      signTransaction: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(\"signedTx\"),\n      requestSignTransactions: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({\n        txs: [{ signedTx: \"signedTx\" }],\n      }),\n    },\n  };\n\n  window.okxwallet = okxwallet;\n\n  return window.okxwallet.near;\n};\n```\n\n- **mockOkx function**: This function creates a mock implementation of the OKX wallet. It defines various methods like `getAccountId`, `requestSignIn`, `signOut`, and others, all mocked using Jest functions.\n- **Mocking behavior**: The mocked methods return predefined values, simulating interactions with the actual wallet without making real API calls.\n\n### Creating the Wallet Instance\n\n```typescript\nconst createOKXWallet = async () => {\n  const injectedOkx = mockOkx();\n  const provider = mock<ProviderService>();\n  provider.sendTransaction.mockResolvedValue(mock<FinalExecutionOutcome>());\n  const { wallet } = await mockWallet<InjectedWallet>(setupOKXWallet(), {\n    provider,\n  });\n\n  return {\n    wallet,\n    injectedOkx,\n  };\n};\n```\n\n- **createOKXWallet function**: This function initializes the mocked OKX wallet and sets up a mock provider service. It uses the `mockWallet` utility to create an instance of the wallet configured with its dependencies.\n- **Return value**: It returns both the `wallet` instance and the mocked `injectedOkx` wallet.\n\n### Cleanup\n\n```typescript\nafterEach(() => {\n  jest.resetModules();\n});\n```\n\n- **Cleanup**: This function resets the Jest modules after each test, ensuring that each test runs in a clean environment.\n\n### Test Suites\n\nThe code is organized into several describe blocks that group related tests:\n\n#### 1. **signIn Tests**\n\n```typescript\ndescribe(\"signIn\", () => {\n  it(\"sign into okx wallet\", async () => {\n    const { wallet, injectedOkx } = await createOKXWallet();\n    const accounts = await wallet.signIn({ contractId: \"test.testnet\" });\n    expect(injectedOkx!.requestSignIn).toHaveBeenCalled();\n    expect(accounts[0]?.accountId).toBe(accountId);\n  });\n});\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: Tests the `signIn` functionality of the OKX wallet.\n- **Assertions**: It checks whether the `requestSignIn` method was called and verifies that the returned account ID matches the expected `accountId`.\n\n#### 2. **signOut Tests**\n\n```typescript\ndescribe(\"signOut\", () => {\n  it(\"sign out of okx wallet\", async () => {\n    const { wallet, injectedOkx } = await createOKXWallet();\n    await wallet.signIn({ contractId: \"test.testnet\" });\n    await wallet.signOut();\n\n    expect(injectedOkx!.signOut).toHaveBeenCalled();\n  });\n});\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: Tests the `signOut` functionality.\n- **Assertions**: It ensures that the `signOut` method is called after signing out.\n\n#### 3. **getAccounts Tests**\n\n```typescript\ndescribe(\"getAccounts\", () => {\n  it(\"returns accounts\", async () => {\n    const { wallet, injectedOkx } = await createOKXWallet();\n    await wallet.signIn({ contractId: \"test.testnet\" });\n    const result = await wallet.getAccounts();\n\n    expect(injectedOkx!.getAccountId).toHaveBeenCalled();\n    expect(result).toEqual([{ accountId, publicKey: undefined }]);\n  });\n});\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: Tests the retrieval of account information.\n- **Assertions**: It checks that `getAccountId` was invoked and verifies the returned accounts structure.\n\n#### 4. **signTransaction Tests**\n\n```typescript\ndescribe(\"signTransaction\", () => {\n  it(\"sign transaction in okx wallet\", async () => {\n    const { wallet, injectedOkx } = await createOKXWallet();\n    await wallet.signIn({ contractId: \"test.testnet\" });\n    await wallet.signAndSendTransaction({\n      signerId: accountId,\n      receiverId: \"test.testnet\",\n      actions: [],\n    });\n\n    expect(injectedOkx!.signTransaction).toHaveBeenCalled();\n  });\n});\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: Tests the signing of a transaction.\n- **Assertions**: It ensures that the `signTransaction` method is called after performing the signing operation.\n\n#### 5. **signAndSendTransactions Tests**\n\n```typescript\ndescribe(\"signAndSendTransactions\", () => {\n  it(\"sign transactions in okx wallet\", async () => {\n    const { wallet, injectedOkx } = await createOKXWallet();\n    await wallet.signIn({ contractId: \"test.testnet\" });\n    const result = await wallet.signAndSendTransactions({\n      transactions,\n    });\n\n    expect(injectedOkx!.requestSignTransactions).toHaveBeenCalled();\n    expect(result.length).toEqual(transactions.length);\n  });\n});\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: Tests the functionality of signing and sending multiple transactions.\n- **Assertions**: It verifies that the `requestSignTransactions` method was called and checks that the result length matches the number of transactions sent.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis code snippet is a comprehensive set of unit tests for the OKX wallet integration with NEAR Protocol. It demonstrates how to mock external dependencies, set up a testing environment, and validate the wallet's functionalities effectively. Each test case is isolated, ensuring that it can run independently of others, which is a best practice in unit testing. By using Jest and mocks, the code achieves a clear and maintainable test setup for the wallet functionalities."}]}

Let's break down the code step by step.\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n1. **User Agent Rules Definition:**\n   ```typescript\n   const userAgentRules = [\n       [\"apple\", /^AppleWebKit\\/([0-9\\.]+).*Gecko\\)$/],\n       [\"curl\", /^curl\\/([0-9\\.]+)$/],\n       [\"searchbot\", SEARCHBOX_UA_REGEX],\n   ];\n   ```\n   - Here, an array `userAgentRules` is defined, where each element is a tuple containing a browser name and a corresponding regular expression (regex) to match against the User-Agent string.\n   - The regex is used to identify specific browsers (like Apple WebKit or curl) from the User-Agent string.\n\n2. **`matchUserAgent` Function:**\n   ```typescript\n   const matchUserAgent = (ua: string): UserAgentMatch => {\n       return (\n           ua !== \"\" &&\n           userAgentRules.reduce<UserAgentMatch>(\n               (matched: UserAgentMatch, [browser, regex]) => {\n                   if (matched) {\n                       return matched; // If a match is already found, return it.\n                   }\n\n                   const uaMatch = regex.exec(ua); // Try to match the regex against the User-Agent string.\n                   return !!uaMatch && [browser, uaMatch]; // Return the match if found.\n               },\n               false\n           )\n       );\n   };\n   ```\n   - The `matchUserAgent` function takes a User-Agent string (`ua`) as input.\n   - It uses the `reduce` method to iterate over `userAgentRules`. The initial value for `matched` is `false`.\n   - For each rule, it checks if a match has already been found. If not, it attempts to match the regex against the User-Agent string.\n   - If a match is found, it returns an array containing the browser name and the match results; otherwise, it continues until all rules are checked.\n\n3. **`isCurrentBrowserSupported` Function:**\n   ```typescript\n   export const isCurrentBrowserSupported = (\n       supportedBrowser: Array<Browser>\n   ): boolean => {\n       if (typeof navigator === \"undefined\") {\n           return false; // If navigator is not defined (e.g., in a non-browser environment), return false.\n       }\n       const matchedRule: UserAgentMatch = matchUserAgent(navigator.userAgent); // Get the matched User-Agent rule.\n       if (!matchedRule) {\n           return false; // Return false if no match is found.\n       }\n\n       const [name] = matchedRule; // Destructure the matched rule to get the browser name.\n       if (name === \"searchbot\") {\n           return false; // If the browser is a search bot, return false.\n       }\n\n       return !!supportedBrowser.find((item) => item === name); // Check if the browser name is in the supported list.\n   };\n   ```\n   - This function checks if the current browser (based on `navigator.userAgent`) is supported.\n   - It first verifies that the `navigator` object is available. If not (e.g., in a server-side context), it returns `false`.\n   - It calls `matchUserAgent` to retrieve any matching browser rules.\n   - If a match is found, it checks if the browser name is \"searchbot\", and if so, it returns `false` because search bots should not be considered supported.\n   - Finally, it checks if the matched browser name is included in the `supportedBrowser` array, returning `true` if it is, and `false` otherwise.\n\n### Summary\nThe code provides a mechanism for detecting the user's browser based on the User-Agent string and checks whether it is among the supported browsers for the application. The use of regex allows for flexible matching of various browser signatures, and the approach ensures that only relevant browsers are considered. This kind of utility is common in web applications to ensure compatibility and provide a seamless user experience."}]}

Build System - Turborepo\n```markdown\nTurborepo provides tooling for orchestrating commands across the monorepo. \nSimilar to Yarn Workspaces, Turborepo can run tasks within each project via a single command, \nbut rather than executing serially, Turborepo has various performance enhancing features \nsuch as task parallelization and local/remote caching.\n```\n- **Turborepo** is introduced as the build system for the project. It simplifies the orchestration of commands across multiple packages in the monorepo.\n- **Task Management**: It allows developers to execute tasks for individual projects efficiently, similar to Yarn Workspaces, but with improved performance.\n- **Performance Features**: Turborepo enhances performance through:\n  - **Task Parallelization**: It enables multiple tasks to run simultaneously, dramatically reducing build times.\n  - **Local/Remote Caching**: This feature caches task outputs, allowing for faster subsequent builds by reusing previously computed results.\n\n### 3. Automation - GitHub Actions\n```markdown\nGithub Actions is used to automate various tasks including PR checks (linting, type checks, and tests).\n```\n- **GitHub Actions** is the automation tool utilized in the project. It automates essential workflows, particularly for pull requests (PRs).\n- **PR Checks**: This includes running linting tools, type checks, and automated tests to ensure code quality and functionality before merging changes into the main codebase.\n\n### Summary\nThe `TOOLING.md` document succinctly describes three essential tools that contribute to the development workflow within the `near-js` project:\n- **PNPM** for efficient package management,\n- **Turborepo** for effective build orchestration,\n- **GitHub Actions** for automating quality checks and other repetitive tasks.\n\nBy using these tools, the NEAR development team can maintain a streamlined, efficient, and high-quality codebase."}]}

This file contains the logic that will be executed on the NEAR blockchain.\n\n2. **ABI Client Generation**:\n   - The `near_abi_client::generate!` macro is used to generate a client named `AbiClient` based on the ABI schema found in `res/adder.json`. This allows for type-safe interaction with the contract methods defined in the ABI.\n\n3. **Async Main Function**:\n   - The `#[tokio::main]` attribute indicates that this is the asynchronous entry point of the program. It allows for asynchronous operations within the `main` function.\n\n4. **Worker Initialization**:\n   - `near_workspaces::sandbox()` creates a testing environment (sandbox) for deploying and interacting with contracts without needing a live network.\n\n5. **Contract Deployment**:\n   - The `dev_deploy` method is called to deploy the contract to the sandbox. The contract's WASM bytecode is supplied as an argument.\n\n6. **ABI Client Initialization**:\n   - An instance of `AbiClient` is created, which is initialized with the deployed contract. This client will provide methods to interact with the contract's functions.\n\n7. **Method Invocation**:\n   - The `add` method is called on `abi_client`, passing in two vectors of integers. This demonstrates a type-safe way to call the contract's method using the generated client.\n\n8. **Result Assertion**:\n   - The result of the `add` method call is asserted to equal `[4, 6]`. This checks that the contract's logic is working as expected and that the output matches the expected result.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis code snippet effectively demonstrates how to set up a NEAR Protocol development environment using the `near_abi_client` to facilitate type-safe interactions with a smart contract. It outlines the entire process from contract deployment to method invocation and result checking, making it a useful reference for developers looking to interact with NEAR contracts programmatically. For further information, the comments direct users to the `near-abi-client` documentation for more detailed usage guidelines."}]}

This link can be embedded into a QR code, sent via email, text or any other means. Within the link, there is a private key that allows the holder to call a method that can create an account and send it assets. Alternatively, if the holder has an account, the assets can be sent there as well.\n\nBy definition, anyone with an access key can interact with the blockchain and since there is a private key embedded in the link, this removes the need for the end-user to have a wallet.\n\n## Motivation\n\nLinkdrops are an extremely powerful tool that enable seamless onboarding and instant crypto experiences with the click of a link. The original [near-linkdrop](https://github.com/near/near-linkdrop) contract provides a minimal interface allowing users to embed $NEAR within an access key and create a simple Web2 style link that can then be used as a means of onboarding. This simple $NEAR linkdrop is not enough as many artists, developers, event coordinators, and applications want to drop more digital assets such as NFTs, FTs, tickets etc.\n\nAs linkdrop implementations start to push the boundaries of what’s possible, new data structures, methods, and interfaces are being developed. There needs to be a standard data model and interface put into place to ensure assets can be claimed independent of the contract they came from. If not, integrating any application with linkdrops will require customized solutions, which would become cumbersome for the developer and deteriorate the user onboarding experience. The linkdrop standard addresses these issues by providing a simple and extensible standard data model and interface.\n\nThe initial discussion can be found [here](https://gov.near.org/t/official-linkdrop-standard/32463/1).\n\n## Specification\n\n### Example Scenarios\n\n_Pre-requisite Steps_: Linkdrop creation:\nThe linkdrop creator that has an account with some $NEAR:\n\n- creates a keypair locally (`pubKey1`, `privKey1`). (The keypair is not written to chain at this time)\n- calls a method on a contract that implements the linkdrop standard in order to create the drop. The `pubKey1` and desired $NEAR amount are both passed in as arguments.\n- The contract maps the `pubKey1` to the desired balance for the linkdrop (`KeyInfo` record).\n- The contract then adds the `pubKey1` as a function call access key with the ability to call `claim` and `create_account_and_claim`. This means that anyone with the `privKey1` (see above), can sign a transaction on behalf of the contract (signer id set to contract id) with a function call to call one of the mentioned functions to claim the assets.\n\n#### Claiming a linkdrop without a NEAR Account\n\nA user with _no_ account can claim the assets associated with an existing public key, already registered in the linkdrop contract:\n\n- generates a new keypair (`pubKey2`, `privKey2`) locally. (This new keypair is not written to chain)\n- chooses a new account ID such as benji.near.\n- calls `create_account_and_claim`. The transaction is signed on behalf of the linkdrop contract (`signer_id` is set to the contract address) using `privKey1`.\n  - the args of this function call will contain both `pubKey2` (which will be used to create a full access key for the new account) and the account ID itself.\n  - the linkdrop contract will delete the access key associated with `pubKey1` so that it cannot be used again.\n  - the linkdrop contract will create the new account and transfer the funds to it alongside any other assets.\n- the user will be able to sign transactions on behalf of the new account using `privKey2`.\n\n#### Claiming a linkdrop with a NEAR Account\n\nA user with an _existing_ account can claim the assets with an existing public key, already registered in the linkdrop contract:\n\n- calls `claim`. The transaction is signed on behalf of the linkdrop contract (`signer_id` is```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The code snippet you provided is part of NEP-0452, which outlines the \"Linkdrop Standard\" for NEAR Protocol. This document is a NEAR Enhancement Proposal (NEP) that defines a standard interface for creating and claiming linkdrops, which are links that allow users to receive assets (such as NEAR tokens, fungible tokens, and non-fungible tokens) without needing to have a pre-existing wallet or account. Below is a detailed breakdown of the key sections of this NEP.\n\n### Breakdown of NEP-0452\n\n#### Metadata Section\nThe initial part of the NEP contains metadata that describes the proposal:\n```markdown\nNEP: 452\nTitle: Linkdrop Standard\nAuthor: Ben Kurrek <ben.kurrek@near.org>, Ken Miyachi <ken.miyachi@near.foundation>\nDiscussionsTo: https://gov.near.org/t/official-linkdrop-standard/32463/1\nStatus: Final\nType: Standards Track\nCategory: Contract\nVersion: 1.0.0\nCreated: 24-Jan-2023\nUpdated: 19-Apr-2023\n```\n- **NEP**: Unique identifier for the proposal.\n- **Title**: Descriptive name of the NEP.\n- **Authors**: Individuals who authored the proposal.\n- **DiscussionsTo**: Link to discussions regarding the NEP.\n- **Status**: Indicates that the NEP is finalized.\n- **Type**: Classifies the NEP within the NEP structure (in this case, it is a standard).\n- **Category**: Specifies that this NEP is related to smart contracts.\n- **Version**: Version of the NEP.\n- **Created/Updated**: Dates indicating when the NEP was created and last updated.\n\n#### Summary Section\nThis section provides a high-level overview of what the Linkdrop Standard is:\n```markdown\n## Summary\n\nA standard interface for linkdrops that support $NEAR, fungible tokens, non-fungible tokens, and is extensible to support new types in the future.\n```\n- **Linkdrops**: A method for transferring assets via a link, making it easier for users to receive tokens without needing a wallet.\n- **Extensibility**: The standard allows for future enhancements to support additional asset types.\n\n#### Motivation Section\nThis provides the rationale behind the proposal:\n```markdown\nLinkdrops are an extremely powerful tool that enable seamless onboarding and instant crypto experiences with the click of a link...\n```\n- **User Experience**: Linkdrops simplify the onboarding process for users by allowing them to receive assets through a straightforward link.\n- **Standardization Needs**: As various applications require different asset types, having a standard interface simplifies the integration of linkdrops across applications.\n\n#### Specification Section\nThis part outlines the practical implementation and usage scenarios of linkdrops:\n```markdown\n### Example Scenarios\n\n_Pre-requisite Steps_: Linkdrop creation:\nThe linkdrop creator that has an account with some $NEAR:\n- creates a keypair locally (`pubKey1`, `privKey1`).\n...\n```\n- **Keypair Generation**: A creator generates a public/private keypair for creating a linkdrop.\n- **Contract Interaction**: The creator calls a method on a contract implementing the Linkdrop Standard to create a linkdrop.\n\n#### Claiming Scenarios\nThe document also describes how users can claim linkdrops:\n1. **Without a NEAR Account**:\n    - A user can generate a new keypair and call `create_account_and_claim` to receive assets and create a new account.\n2. **With an Existing NEAR Account**:\n    - An existing account holder can call `claim` to receive the assets associated with the linkdrop.\n\n### Conclusion\nNEP-0452 introduces a standardized way to create and manage linkdrops on the NEAR blockchain, enhancing user onboarding and making asset transfers more accessible. By creating a structured method for handling linkdrops, the proposal aims to streamline the process for both developers and users, thereby fostering broader adoption of blockchain technology.\n\nThis NEP is critical for developers looking to implement linkdrops within their applications, as it provides a clear and extensible framework to work with various asset types in the NEAR ecosystem."}]}

Thus it is a mistake to assume that the original token owner will receive funds if they are not included in the payout.\n\nNFT and financial contracts vary in implementation. This means that some extra CPU cycles may occur in one NFT contract and not another. Furthermore, a financial contract may accept fungible tokens, native NEAR, or another entity as payment. Transferring native NEAR tokens is less expensive in gas than sending fungible tokens. For these reasons, the maximum length of payouts may vary according to the customization of the smart contracts.\n\n## Drawbacks\n\nThere is an introduction of trust that the contract calling `nft_transfer_payout` will indeed pay out to all intended parties. However, since the calling contract will typically be something like a marketplace used by end users, malicious actors might be found out more easily and might have less incentive.  \nThere is an assumption that NFT contracts will understand the limits of gas and not allow for a number of payouts that cannot be achieved.\n\n## Future possibilities\n\nIn the future, the NFT contract itself may be able to place an NFT transfer is a state that is \"pending transfer\" until all payouts have been awarded. This would keep all the information inside the NFT and remove trust.\n\n## Errata\n\n- Version `2.1.0` adds a memo parameter to `nft_transfer_payout`, which previously forced implementers of `2.0.0` to pass `None` to the inner `nft_transfer`. Also refactors `max_len_payout` to be an option type.\n- Version `2.0.0` contains the intended `approval_id` of `u64` instead of the stringified `U64` version. This was an oversight, but since the standard was live for a few months before noticing, the team thought it best to bump the major version.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's break down the provided code snippet from the NEAR Protocol's NEP-199 documentation, specifically the function `nft_transfer_payout`. This function is part of a smart contract that manages Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and handles the payout mechanism when an NFT is transferred.\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n```rust\n#[payable]\nfn nft_transfer_payout(\n    &mut self,\n    receiver_id: AccountId,\n    token_id: String,\n    approval_id: Option<u64>,\n    memo: Option<String>,\n    balance: U128,\n    max_len_payout: Option<u32>,\n) -> Payout {\n    assert_one_yocto(); // Ensure that the contract receives exactly one yoctoNEAR for this function call\n\n    let payout = self.nft_payout(token_id, balance); // Calculate the payout for the given token and balance\n\n    self.nft_transfer(receiver_id, token_id, approval_id, memo); // Transfer the NFT to the receiver\n\n    payout // Return the calculated payout\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Parameters and Logic\n\n1. **Parameters**:\n   - `receiver_id: AccountId`: The account that will receive the NFT.\n   - `token_id: String`: The unique identifier of the NFT being transferred.\n   - `approval_id: Option<u64>`: An optional approval ID for the transfer, which is used to ensure that the transfer is authorized.\n   - `memo: Option<String>`: An optional memo that can be included with the transaction, often used for notes or additional information.\n   - `balance: U128`: The amount of NEAR (or equivalent in another currency) that is being used for the payout calculation.\n   - `max_len_payout: Option<u32>`: An optional maximum length for the payout, which, if exceeded, will cause the function to panic.\n\n2. **Function Logic**:\n   - The `assert_one_yocto()` function checks that the caller has attached exactly one yoctoNEAR to the transaction. This is a common pattern in NEAR to ensure that the function is called with the correct amount of attached funds.\n   - `self.nft_payout(token_id, balance)` calculates the payout based on the `token_id` and the provided `balance`. This function is expected to return a `Payout` struct that contains information about how much should be distributed and to whom.\n   - `self.nft_transfer(...)` performs the actual transfer of the NFT to the specified `receiver_id`. It uses the provided `approval_id` and `memo` as part of the transfer process.\n   - Finally, the function returns the `payout` value, which contains the results of the payout calculation.\n\n### Error Handling and Considerations\n\n- **Fallback on Error**: If the payout length exceeds `max_len_payout` or if a malformed payout is returned, the transaction should revert, and any funds should be sent back to the original token owner. This is crucial for maintaining trust and preventing loss of funds.\n  \n- **Potential Pitfalls**: \n  - The payout must include all accounts that should receive funds; assuming that the original token owner will receive funds without being explicitly included in the payout can lead to issues.\n  - Variability in NFT and financial contract implementations means that gas costs can differ based on how these contracts are designed. This can affect the maximum length of payouts.\n\n### Drawbacks\n\n- This function relies on the trust that the calling contract (often a marketplace) will appropriately distribute the payouts. If a malicious actor were to create a marketplace that does not perform this action, it could result in losses for the original token owner.\n- There is an assumption that NFT contracts will handle gas limits appropriately, not allowing for a number of payouts that cannot be executed within the allowed gas.\n\n### Future Possibilities\n\n- There is a suggestion that, in the future, NFT contracts might implement a \"pending transfer\" state for NFTs, which would delay the transfer until all payouts are confirmed. This would centralize the information and reduce reliance on external contracts to handle payouts.\n\n### Errata\n\nThe documentation mentions changes made in different versions of NEP-199, highlighting the introduction of new parameters and corrections to types. This kind of versioning information is important for developers who are upgrading or maintaining their contracts to ensure compatibility.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis function exemplifies a common pattern in the NEAR ecosystem for handling NFT transfers with associated payouts. The careful consideration of error handling, gas costs, and trust models is crucial for building robust decentralized applications. Understanding this function and its implications is vital for developers working on NFT-related projects in the NEAR Protocol."}]}

Let's break down the provided code snippet from the `near-sdk` library, specifically focusing on the purpose and functionality of this section. This code is part of a vector-like data structure implementation in Rust, which is commonly used in smart contracts on the NEAR Protocol.\n\n### Code Explanation\n\n```rust\n// Only delete and don't load any values before n\nfor _ in 0..n {\n    let next = self.range.next_back()?;\n    // Delete all values in advance, values will be shifted over on drop.\n    // This avoids having to load and deserialize any elements skipped over.\n    self.vec.values.set(next, None);\n}\nself.next_back()\n```\n\n### Detailed Breakdown\n\n1. **Commentary**:\n   - The first comment indicates that this loop will delete a certain number of elements (specified by `n`) without loading or deserializing the values that are being deleted. This is an optimization technique.\n\n2. **Loop (`for _ in 0..n`)**:\n   - This loop iterates `n` times. The underscore (`_`) indicates that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. Instead, the focus is on performing the deletion operation.\n\n3. **Fetching the Next Element to Delete**:\n   ```rust\n   let next = self.range.next_back()?;\n   ```\n   - `self.range.next_back()?` retrieves the next index (or position) from the back of a range iterator. The `?` operator is used to handle any potential errors that may arise while fetching the next element. This line is crucial as it determines which element will be deleted in the current iteration.\n\n4. **Deleting Values**:\n   ```rust\n   self.vec.values.set(next, None);\n   ```\n   - This line is responsible for deleting the value at the index `next`. It effectively sets the value at that index to `None`. By doing this, the element is marked as deleted, but it doesn't immediately load or deserialize the value, which is efficient. \n\n5. **Comment on Deletion**:\n   - The comment explains that by marking the values as deleted in advance and allowing them to be shifted over on drop (when the memory is freed), we avoid unnecessary loading and deserialization of elements that would be skipped. This is particularly useful in contexts where performance is critical, such as in blockchain applications where gas costs matter.\n\n6. **Return Next Item**:\n   ```rust\n   self.next_back()\n   ```\n   - After the loop completes, `self.next_back()` is called, which will likely retrieve the next item from the range after the deletions have been processed. This ensures that the iterator can continue to function correctly after elements have been removed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis code snippet is an efficient way to delete a specified number of elements from a vector-like structure without incurring the overhead of loading and deserializing each element. It leverages Rust's ownership and memory management features to maintain performance, which is crucial in the NEAR Protocol's context of executing smart contracts. The design choices made here align with the principles of performance optimization and resource management in blockchain applications. \n\nIf you have further questions about specific parts of the code or how it fits into the broader context of the NEAR SDK, feel free to ask!"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain the following code snippet from NEAR repository file `examples/react/index.d.ts`:\n```/* eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any */\ndeclare module \"*.svg\" {\n  const content: any;\n  export const ReactComponent: any;\n  export default content;\n}\n```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This code snippet is a TypeScript declaration file that provides type definitions for SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) files when imported into a React application. Let’s break down each part of the code:\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n1. **ESLint Directive**:\n   ```typescript\n   /* eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any */\n   ```\n   - This line disables a specific ESLint rule that warns against the use of `any` type in TypeScript. By disabling this, the developer acknowledges the use of `any`, which allows for flexibility but sacrifices type safety.\n\n2. **Module Declaration**:\n   ```typescript\n   declare module \"*.svg\" {\n   ```\n   - This line declares a new module for any file that ends with the `.svg` extension. It tells TypeScript to treat all SVG files as modules, allowing them to be imported in TypeScript files.\n\n3. **Content Export**:\n   ```typescript\n   const content: any;\n   ```\n   - Here, `content` is declared as a constant of type `any`. This means that when an SVG file is imported, the default export will be of type `any`. In practice, this could be a string representing the file path or the raw SVG content.\n\n4. **React Component Export**:\n   ```typescript\n   export const ReactComponent: any;\n   ```\n   - This line exports a constant named `ReactComponent`, also of type `any`. This allows the SVG to be imported as a React component. For example, if you have an SVG file named `logo.svg`, you could use it in a React component like this:\n     ```javascript\n     import { ReactComponent as Logo } from './logo.svg';\n     ```\n\n5. **Default Export**:\n   ```typescript\n   export default content;\n   ```\n   - This line exports the `content` as the default export of the module. This means you can also import the SVG file directly without destructuring:\n     ```javascript\n     import logo from './logo.svg';\n     ```\n\n### Usage in a React Application\n\nWith this declaration, whenever an SVG file is imported, TypeScript knows how to handle it. Here’s how you might typically see it used in a React component:\n\n```javascript\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ReactComponent as Logo } from './logo.svg'; // Import as React component\nimport logo from './logo.svg'; // Import as default content\n\nconst App: React.FC = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Welcome to My App</h1>\n      <Logo /> {/* Using the SVG as a component */}\n      <img src={logo} alt=\"Logo\" /> {/* Using the SVG as an image source */}\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\n### Summary\n\nThis TypeScript declaration file is essential for allowing TypeScript to understand how to import SVG files in a React application, providing flexibility in how they can be used (either as a React component or as a standard image). However, the use of `any` reduces the type safety that TypeScript offers, which developers should keep in mind. If possible, more specific types could be defined to enhance type safety in the application."}]}

Let’s break down the key components of this code.\n\n### Overview of the Code Structure\n\n1. **Generic Worker Implementation**:\n   The first part of the code defines a generic implementation for a `Worker<T>`, where `T` is a trait bound to `Network`. This implementation allows the worker to interact with contracts on the specified network.\n\n2. **Contract Interaction**:\n   The `call` function allows users to invoke a contract's change function. It creates and returns a `CallTransaction` object, which encapsulates the details of the transaction.\n\n3. **Specific Worker Implementation (Sandbox)**:\n   The second part specifies implementations for a `Worker<Sandbox>`, which might be a specific type of worker for interacting with a sandbox network. This includes methods for managing accounts and transactions.\n\n### Detailed Explanation of Key Functions\n\n#### 1. `call` Method\n\n```rust\npub fn call(\n    &self,\n    signer: &InMemorySigner,\n    contract_id: &AccountId,\n    function: &str,\n) -> CallTransaction {\n    CallTransaction::new(\n        self.clone().coerce(),\n        contract_id.to_owned(),\n        signer.clone(),\n        function,\n    )\n}\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: This method is used to create a transaction that calls a specified function on a smart contract.\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `signer`: An instance of `InMemorySigner` that will sign the transaction.\n  - `contract_id`: The account ID of the target contract.\n  - `function`: The name of the function to be called on the contract.\n- **Return Value**: It returns a `CallTransaction` object initialized with the worker's state, contract ID, signer, and function name.\n\n#### 2. `root_account` Method\n\n```rust\npub fn root_account(&self) -> Result<Account> {\n    let signer = self.workspace.root_signer()?;\n    Ok(Account::new(signer, self.clone().coerce()))\n}\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: This method retrieves the root account associated with the worker.\n- **Return Value**: It returns a result containing an `Account` object that is initialized with the root signer and the worker's state.\n\n#### 3. `import_contract` Method\n\n```rust\npub fn import_contract<'a>(\n    &self,\n    id: &'a AccountId,\n    worker: &Worker<impl Network + 'static>,\n) -> ImportContractTransaction<'a> {\n    ImportContractTransaction::new(id, worker.clone().coerce(), self.clone())\n}\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: This method allows for importing a contract from a specified network.\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `id`: The account ID of the contract to be imported.\n  - `worker`: A reference to another worker that defines the network.\n- **Return Value**: Returns an `ImportContractTransaction` object, which can be used to specify further details about the import.\n\n#### 4. `patch` Method\n\n```rust\npub fn patch(&self, account_id: &AccountId) -> PatchTransaction {\n    PatchTransaction::new(self, account_id.clone())\n}\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: This method prepares a `PatchTransaction` for modifying the state of an account.\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `account_id`: The ID of the account to be patched.\n- **Return Value**: Returns a new `PatchTransaction` object.\n\n#### 5. `patch_state` Method\n\n```rust\npub async fn patch_state(\n    &self,\n    contract_id: &AccountId,\n    key: &[u8],\n    value: &[u8],\n) -> Result<()> {\n    self.workspace.patch_state(contract_id, key, value).await\n}\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: This async method allows the worker to modify the state of a contract on the sandbox.\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `contract_id`: The ID of the contract whose state is to be patched.\n  - `key`: The key for the state entry.\n  - `value`: The new value to set for the specified key.\n- **Return Value**: Returns a `Result` type indicating success or failure.\n\n#### 6. `fast_forward` Method\n\n```rust\npub async fn fast_forward(&self, delta_height: u64) -> Result<()> {\n    self.workspace.fast_forward(delta_height).await\n}\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: This async function allows the worker to fast forward the state of the blockchain by a specified number of blocks.\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `delta_height`: The number of blocks to skip forward.\n- **Return Value**: Returns a `Result` indicating success or failure.\n\n#### 7. `rpc_port` and `rpc_addr` Methods\n\n```rust\npub fn rpc_port(&self) -> Option<u16> {\n    self.workspace.server.rpc_port()\n}\n\npub fn rpc_addr(&self) -> String {\n    self.workspace.server.rpc_addr()\n}\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: These methods are used to retrieve the RPC port and address that the worker uses to connect to the network.\n- **Return Values**: \n  - `rpc_port`: Returns an `Option<u16>` indicating the port if available.\n  - `rpc_addr`: Returns a `String` containing the RPC address.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis code snippet is part of a larger framework enabling interaction with smart contracts on a NEAR Protocol blockchain. It provides a structured approach to create, modify, and manage transactions and accounts, particularly in a sandbox environment for testing purposes. Each method is carefully designed to encapsulate specific functionalities, allowing developers to easily integrate and utilize these capabilities in their applications."}]}

This allows for method calls and responses to be exchanged in a structured way. Below is a detailed breakdown of the code snippet:\n\n### Key Components of the Code\n\n1. **Imports**:\n   - `EventEmitter`: A class from the Node.js `events` module that allows for creating and handling events.\n   - Custom types and interfaces (like `IFrameRPCError`, `IMessageEvent`, `IMessagePoster`, etc.) are imported from local files, which define the structure and types used throughout the module.\n\n2. **Utility Function**:\n   ```typescript\n   function responseObjToError(obj: { code: number; message: string; }) {\n       return new IFrameRPCError(obj.message, obj.code);\n   }\n   ```\n   - This function converts an error response object into an `IFrameRPCError` object, encapsulating the error message and code.\n\n3. **Interface Definition**:\n   ```typescript\n   export interface IRPCOptions {\n       target: IMessagePoster;\n       requesterId: string;\n       origin?: string;\n       protocolVersion?: string;\n       receiver?: IMessageReceiver;\n   }\n   ```\n   - Defines the options that can be passed to the `IFrameRPC` constructor, such as the target for message posting and the ID of the requester.\n\n4. **Class Definition**:\n   ```typescript\n   export class IFrameRPC extends EventEmitter {\n       ...\n   }\n   ```\n   - `IFrameRPC` extends `EventEmitter`, allowing it to emit and listen for events.\n\n5. **Constructor**:\n   ```typescript\n   constructor(private readonly options: IRPCOptions) {\n       super();\n       this.removeMessageListener = (options.receiver || windowReceiver).readMessages(this.messageEventListener);\n       this.isReady = this.createReadyPromise();\n   }\n   ```\n   - The constructor initializes the instance, sets up the message listener, and creates a promise that resolves when the RPC is ready.\n\n6. **Creating a Ready Promise**:\n   ```typescript\n   private createReadyPromise() {\n       return new Promise<void>(resolve => {\n           const response = {protocolVersion: this.options.protocolVersion || '1.0'};\n           ...\n       });\n   }\n   ```\n   - This method creates a promise that resolves when the RPC is ready, allowing the caller to wait for the setup to complete.\n\n7. **Static Method for Getting a Ready Instance**:\n   ```typescript\n   static getReadyInstance(options: IRPCOptions): Promise<IFrameRPC> {\n       const rpc = new IFrameRPC(options);\n       return rpc.isReady.then(() => rpc);\n   }\n   ```\n   - A static method to create an `IFrameRPC` instance and return a promise that resolves when it is ready.\n\n8. **Method Binding**:\n   ```typescript\n   public bindMethodHandler<T>(method: string, handler: (params: T) => Promise<any> | any): this {\n       ...\n   }\n   ```\n   - This method allows binding a method handler to a specified method name. When the method is called via RPC, it will execute the bound handler and send the response back.\n\n9. **Calling an RPC Method**:\n   ```typescript\n   public callMethod<T>(method: string, params: object): Promise<T> {\n       ...\n   }\n   ```\n   - This method constructs an RPC message, sends it, and returns a promise that resolves with the response.\n\n10. **Destroying the Instance**:\n    ```typescript\n    public destroy() {\n        this.emit('destroy');\n        this.removeMessageListener();\n    }\n    ```\n    - This method cleans up the instance by emitting a destroy event and removing the message listener.\n\n11. **Handling Responses**:\n    ```typescript\n    private handleResponse(message: IRPCResponse<any>) {\n        ...\n    }\n    ```\n    - This method (not fully shown) would handle incoming responses to RPC calls, likely invoking the appropriate callback stored in the `calls` object.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe `IFrameRPC` class encapsulates the logic for managing RPC calls between a parent window and an iframe. It uses event-driven programming to handle method calls and responses, allowing seamless communication in a structured way. The implementation includes robust error handling and event management, making it a powerful utility for developers working with iframes in a web application context. \n\nBy using this class, developers can easily set up an RPC mechanism to invoke methods in an iframe and handle the results or errors in a clean and organized manner."}]}

If not, it checks if `Object.create` is supported and defines a new binding function accordingly.\n- The binding function creates a property descriptor for the property `k` from module `m`, and if it meets certain conditions, it assigns it to the object `o` under the key `k2`.\n\n```javascript\nvar __exportStar = (this && this.__exportStar) || function(m, exports) {\n    for (var p in m) if (p !== \"default\" && !Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(exports, p)) __createBinding(exports, m, p);\n};\n```\n- The `__exportStar` function is defined to re-export all properties from module `m` to the `exports` object.\n- It iterates through all properties in `m`, skipping the default export and any properties that have already been exported, and calls `__createBinding` to bind them to `exports`.\n\n```javascript\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", { value: true });\n```\n- This line sets the `__esModule` property on the `exports` object to `true`, indicating that this module is using ES module syntax.\n\n```javascript\n__exportStar(require(\"./near-account\"), exports);\n__exportStar(require(\"./near-account-manager\"), exports);\n__exportStar(require(\"./account-manager\"), exports);\n__exportStar(require(\"./account\"), exports);\n```\n- These lines call the `__exportStar` function to re-export all exports from the specified modules: `./near-account`, `./near-account-manager`, `./account-manager`, and `./account`.\n- This allows users of this module to import any of the exports from these files directly from this module, effectively consolidating the exports into a single interface.\n\n```javascript\n//# sourceMappingURL=index.js.map\n```\n- This comment is used for source mapping, which helps in debugging by mapping the minified code back to the original source code.\n\n### Summary\n\nOverall, this code snippet is a part of a module that uses a pattern to re-export various account-related components from different files. It provides a streamlined way to access these components through a single import, simplifying the usage for developers working with the NEAR Protocol JavaScript SDK. The use of helper functions like `__createBinding` and `__exportStar` suggests that this code is transpiled (possibly from TypeScript) to support compatibility across different JavaScript environments."}]}

Let's break down the key points and concepts presented in the snippet:\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n1. **`bfPeerSet` Structure**:\n   - This refers to a data structure that presumably utilizes a Bloom filter (indicated by \"bf\") to manage peer connections in a network. \n   - The goal of using such a structure is to minimize the number of updates and reduce memory usage. \n\n2. **Security Vulnerability**:\n   - The concern here is that if the hash function used in the `bfPeerSet` is known, it could lead to potential security risks, particularly from hash collisions. \n   - A hash collision occurs when two different inputs produce the same hash output, which can compromise the integrity of the routing table exchange process.\n\n3. **Increase in `IbfSet` Structures**:\n   - The document suggests increasing the number of `IBF` (Invertible Bloom Filter) structures from a range of `2^10..2^17` to `2^10..2^20`.\n   - This increase would improve the ability to recover the set difference (the unique elements in a set) without significant loss, allowing for differences up to `2^20/3` instead of `2^17/3`.\n   - However, this comes with an increased memory overhead from 160 MiB to 640 MiB. \n\n4. **Simplifying the Edge Exchange Algorithm**:\n   - The proposed simplification involves only exchanging the hashes of known edges between peers instead of the full edge data itself.\n   - For example, sending a list of 4-byte hashes for all known edges would reduce the data sent from 400 MiB (for 1 million edges) to just 4 MiB, significantly improving efficiency.\n   - However, while this approach reduces data size, it is noted that it may not be as bandwidth-efficient as the previous implementation.\n\n### Future Improvements\n\n1. **Reduce Memory Usage**:\n   - A suggestion is made to use a fixed number of `IbfPeerSet` structures per node (e.g., 10). This would require assessing the likelihood of edge collisions.\n   - The potential risk remains that it may still be feasible to create a set of edges that would lead to failed recovery from the `IBF` for one node due to collisions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOverall, the code snippet outlines a thoughtful analysis of the trade-offs involved in optimizing the routing table exchange mechanism within NEAR Protocol's network architecture. The focus is on balancing memory efficiency, security, and data exchange efficiency, which is crucial for maintaining robust peer-to-peer communication in a decentralized network. \n\n### Practical Implications\n\nFor developers working with network protocols or implementing similar data structures, understanding these trade-offs is vital. They should carefully consider the implications of using various data structures and algorithms, particularly in the context of security and performance. \n\nIf you have further questions about specific implementations or concepts, feel free to ask!"}]}

These actions are essential components of transactions, which dictate how accounts interact with one another and how smart contracts are managed. Below is a detailed breakdown of the provided code snippet and its context.\n\n### Overview of Actions in NEAR\n\nIn NEAR, actions are defined as an enumeration (`enum`) which encapsulates different behaviors that can be executed within a transaction. Each action type corresponds to a specific operation that can modify the state of the blockchain. Here's a brief overview of each action included in the `Action` enum:\n\n```rust\npub enum Action {\n    CreateAccount(CreateAccountAction),\n    DeployContract(DeployContractAction),\n    FunctionCall(FunctionCallAction),\n    Transfer(TransferAction),\n    Stake(StakeAction),\n    AddKey(AddKeyAction),\n    DeleteKey(DeleteKeyAction),\n    DeleteAccount(DeleteAccountAction),\n    Delegate(SignedDelegateAction),\n}\n```\n\n### Detailed Breakdown of Actions\n\n1. **CreateAccount**: This action is used to create a new account on the blockchain. It requires specific validation to ensure that the account ID is valid and that the action is performed by an authorized account (e.g., the registrar).\n\n2. **DeployContract**: This action allows users to deploy smart contracts to the blockchain. The contract code must meet certain size restrictions, as defined by the genesis configuration.\n\n3. **FunctionCall**: This action calls a specified method of a deployed smart contract, allowing for the execution of logic defined within the contract.\n\n4. **Transfer**: This action facilitates the transfer of tokens from one account to another. It includes validation to prevent overflow errors.\n\n5. **Stake**: This action is related to validating nodes on the network. It allows accounts to stake tokens with a specified public key, which must be compatible with the NEAR staking requirements.\n\n6. **AddKey**: This action is used to add a public key to an account, enabling access to the account with that key.\n\n7. **DeleteKey**: This action removes a public key from an account, effectively revoking access associated with that key.\n\n8. **DeleteAccount**: This action deletes an account from the blockchain, which can only be executed under specific conditions.\n\n9. **Delegate**: This action allows an account to delegate its rights to another account, typically used in the context of governance or staking.\n\n### Key Constraints on Actions\n\nThe document specifies that several actions have constraints regarding the `predecessor_id` and `receiver_id`:\n\n- For actions such as `DeployContract`, `Stake`, `AddKey`, `DeleteKey`, and `DeleteAccount`, `predecessor_id` (the account initiating the action) must be the same as `receiver_id` (the account on which the action is performed).\n\n- If the first action is `CreateAccount`, it allows the `predecessor_id` to act on the newly created account for subsequent actions until a `DeleteAccount` action is performed.\n\n### CreateAccountAction\n\nThe `CreateAccountAction` struct is defined as follows:\n\n```rust\npub struct CreateAccountAction {}\n```\n\n#### Outcomes and Errors\n\n- **Outcome**: When executed, it creates an account with the specified `receiver_id` and initializes its storage usage.\n  \n- **Errors**: The action can fail with specific errors, including:\n  - `CreateAccountOnlyByRegistrar`: Thrown if the account creation violates the registrar's constraints (e.g., trying to create a top-level account improperly).\n  - `CreateAccountNotAllowed`: Thrown if the new account does not follow the correct hierarchical structure relative to the `predecessor_id`.\n\n### DeployContractAction\n\nThe `DeployContractAction` struct is defined as:\n\n```rust\npub struct DeployContractAction {\n    pub code: Vec<u8>\n}\n```\n\n#### Outcomes and Errors\n\n- **Outcome**: This action assigns the provided contract code to the specified account.\n\n- **Errors**:\n  - `ContractSizeExceeded`: Triggered if the provided contract code exceeds the maximum allowed size.\n  - `StorageError`: Indicates issues with the state or storage during execution.\n\n### FunctionCallAction\n\nThe `FunctionCallAction` struct enables calling methods of deployed smart contracts:\n\n```rust\npub struct FunctionCallAction {\n    pub method_name: String,\n    pub args: Vec<u8>,\n    pub gas: Gas,\n    pub deposit: Balance,\n}\n```\n\n### TransferAction\n\nThe `TransferAction` struct facilitates token transfers:\n\n```rust\npub struct TransferAction {\n    pub deposit: Balance,\n}\n```\n\n#### Errors\n\n- If the transfer would cause an overflow in the account balance, it returns a `StorageInconsistentState` error.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis code snippet provides a comprehensive overview of the actions available in the NEAR Protocol, outlining their purpose, outcomes, and potential errors. Understanding these actions is crucial for developers working with NEAR, as they form the foundation for transactions and interactions with smart contracts on the blockchain. The mechanism of actions, along with their constraints and error handling, is designed to ensure security and proper governance within the ecosystem."}]}

By setting it to 'node', it indicates that the tests will be executed in a Node.js environment, which is typical for backend applications.\n\n4. **testRegex**:\n   - This regular expression defines which files Jest will consider as test files. It allows for flexibility in naming conventions:\n     - Files located in a `/tests/` directory.\n     - Files matching the naming pattern of `.test.js`, `.test.ts`, `.spec.js`, or `.spec.ts` anywhere in the directory structure.\n\n5. **transform**:\n   - The `transform` property allows you to specify how files should be processed before tests are run. In this case, any file matching the regex `^.+\\\\.[tj]s$` (which means any `.ts` or `.js` file) will be processed by `ts-jest`.\n   - **tsconfig: { allowJs: true }**: This option within the transform configuration allows JavaScript files to be included in the compilation process, meaning that both TypeScript and JavaScript files can be tested together.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis configuration file is essential for setting up a testing environment for a TypeScript project that uses Jest.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain the following code snippet from NEAR repository file `specs/Standards/Tokens/MultiToken/Core.md`:\n```# Multi Token\n\n:::caution\nThis is part of the proposed spec [NEP-245](https://github.com/near/NEPs/blob/master/neps/nep-0245.md) and is subject to change.\n:::\n\nVersion `1.0.0`\n\n## Summary\n\nA standard interface for a multi token standard that supports fungible, semi-fungible,non-fungible, and tokens of any type, allowing for ownership, transfer, and batch transfer of tokens regardless of specific type.\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nIn the three years since [ERC-1155] was ratified by the Ethereum Community, Multi Token based contracts have proven themselves valuable assets. Many blockchain projects emulate this standard for representing multiple token assets classes in a single contract. The ability to reduce transaction overhead for marketplaces, video games, DAOs, and exchanges is appealing to the blockchain ecosystem and simplifies transactions for developers. \n\nHaving a single contract represent NFTs, FTs, and tokens that sit in-between greatly improves efficiency. The standard also introduced the ability to make batch requests with multiple asset classes reducing complexity. This standard allows operations that currently require _many_ transactions to be completed in a single transaction that can transfer not only NFTs and FTs, but any tokens that are a part of same token contract.\n\nWith this standard, we have sought to take advantage of the ability of the NEAR blockchain to scale. Its sharded runtime, and [storage staking] model that decouples [gas] fees from storage demand, enables ultra low transaction fees and greater on chain storage ( see [Metadata] extension).   \n\nWith the aforementioned, it is noteworthy to mention that like the [NFT] standard the Multi Token standard, implements `mt_transfer_call`,\nwhich allows, a user to attach many tokens to a call to a separate contract. Additionally, this standard includes an optional [Approval Management] extension. The extension allows marketplaces to trade on behalf of a user, providing additional flexibility for dApps.\n\nPrior art:\n\n- [ERC-721]\n- [ERC-1155]\n- [NEAR Fungible Token Standard][FT], which first pioneered the \"transfer and call\" technique\n- [NEAR Non-Fungible Token Standard][NFT]\n## Rationale\n\nWhy have another standard, aren't fungible and non-fungible tokens enough?  The current fungible token and non-fungible token standards, do not provide support for representing many FT tokens in a single contract, as well as the flexibility to define different token types with different behavior in a single contract. This is something that makes it difficult to be interoperable with other major blockchain networks, that implement standards that allow for representation of many different FT tokens in a single contract such as Ethereum.\n\nThe standard here introduces a few concepts that evolve the original [ERC-1155] standard to have more utility, while maintaining the original flexibility of the standard. So keeping that in mind, we are defining this as a new token type. It combines two main features of FT and NFT. It allows us to represent many token types in a single contract, and it's possible to store the amount for each token.\n\nThe decision to not use FT and NFT as explicit token types was taken to allow the community to define their own standards and meanings through metadata. As standards evolve on other networks, this specification allows the standard to be able to represent tokens across networks accurately, without necessarily restricting the behavior to any preset definition. \n\nThe issues with this in general is a problem with defining what metadata means and how is that interpreted. We have chosen to follow the pattern that is currently in use on Ethereum in the [ERC-1155] standard. That pattern relies on people to make extensions or to make signals as to how they want the metadata to be represented for their use case. \n\nOne of the areas that has broad sweeping implications from the [ERC-1155] standard is the lack of direct access to metadata. With Near's sharding we are able to have a [Metadata Extension](Metadata.md) for the standard that exists on chain. So developers and users are not required to use an indexer to understand, how to interact or interpret tokens, via token identifiers that they receive.\n\nAnother extension that we made was to provide an explicit ability for developers and users to group or link together series of NFTs/FTs or any combination of tokens. This provides additional flexiblity that the  [ERC-1155] standard only has loose guidelines on. This was chosen to make it easy for consumers to understand the relationship between tokens within the contract. \n\nTo recap, we choose to create this standard, to improve interoperability, developer ease of use, and to extend token representability beyond what was available directly in the FT or NFT standards. We believe this to be another tool in the developer's toolkit.

Below, I will break down and explain the contents of this documentation in detail.\n\n### Overview of the Multi Token Standard (NEP-245)\n\n**1. Purpose of the Standard:**\n   - The document introduces a standard for a multi-token interface that supports various types of tokens: \n     - **Fungible Tokens (FTs)**: Tokens that are interchangeable and have a uniform value (e.g., currencies).\n     - **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)**: Unique tokens that represent ownership of a specific item or asset (e.g., digital art).\n     - **Semi-Fungible Tokens**: Tokens that can behave as both fungible and non-fungible, depending on certain conditions.\n\n**2. Motivation:**\n   - The motivation behind creating this standard stems from the success of the ERC-1155 standard on Ethereum, which allows multiple token types to be managed in a single contract. This approach has proven beneficial for various applications, including marketplaces, games, and decentralized organizations (DAOs).\n   - Key advantages include:\n     - Reduced transaction overhead by allowing batch transfers.\n     - Simplified user interactions by enabling multiple assets to be managed in one transaction.\n\n**3. NEAR Blockchain Advantages:**\n   - The document highlights NEAR's unique features:\n     - **Sharded Runtime**: This allows for scalability and efficient processing of transactions.\n     - **Storage Staking Model**: This decouples gas fees from storage demands, leading to lower costs for users.\n\n**4. Core Features:**\n   - The Multi Token standard supports a method called `mt_transfer_call`, enabling users to attach multiple tokens when invoking another contract. This feature enhances the capabilities of decentralized applications (dApps).\n   - An optional **Approval Management** extension allows markets to trade tokens on behalf of users, giving more flexibility.\n\n**5. Rationale for the Standard:**\n   - The documentation argues that existing standards for FTs and NFTs are not sufficient for representing multiple token types in a single contract. The NEP-245 standard aims to combine the best features of both FTs and NFTs while allowing for greater flexibility.\n   - The decision to avoid strict definitions of FT and NFT types enables the community to define their own standards through metadata.\n\n**6. Metadata Handling:**\n   - Unlike existing standards that may rely on external indexers for metadata access, NEAR's Multi Token standard incorporates a **Metadata Extension** that allows metadata to exist on-chain. This improves usability and interaction with tokens.\n   - The standard also provides mechanisms for grouping and linking tokens, enhancing the user experience.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the proposed Multi Token standard in the NEAR ecosystem. Its focus on interoperability, reduced transaction complexity, and developer convenience positions it as a valuable tool for building decentralized applications.\n\nOverall, NEP-245 seeks to advance the capabilities of token management on NEAR, allowing developers to create more versatile and efficient applications that can handle various token types seamlessly."}]}

It ensures that the approval system behaves as expected under various scenarios, which is crucial for the security and reliability of NFT contracts on the NEAR Protocol."}]}

For example, with an NFT contract, you can perform some operation with NFTs you have ownership of, but you cannot manipulate NFTs that are owned by other accounts since the smart contract is coded with checks to reject that. This is the expected behavior of the NFT contract. However, you may want to change another person's NFT for a test setup. This is called \"arbitrary mutation on contract state\" and can be done with `patchState`. Alternatively you can stop the node, dump state at genesis, edit genesis, and restart the node. The later approach is more complicated to do and also cannot be performed without restarting the node.\n\nIt is true that you can alter contract code, accounts, and access keys using normal transactions via the `DeployContract`, `CreateAccount`, and `AddKey` [actions](https://nomicon.io/RuntimeSpec/Actions.html?highlight=actions#actions). But this limits you to altering your own account or sub-account. `patchState` allows you to perform these operations on any account.\n\nTo see an example of how to do this, see the [patch-state test](https://github.com/near/workspaces-js/blob/main/__tests__/02.patch-state.ava.ts).\n\nTime Traveling\n===============\n\nIn Sandbox-mode, you can forward time-related state (the block height, timestamp and epoch height) with `fastForward`.\n\nThis means contracts which require time sensitive data do not need to sit and wait the same amount of time for blocks on the sandbox to be produced.\nWe can simply just call the api to get us further in time.\n\nFor an example, see the [fast-forward test](./__tests__/08.fast-forward.ava.ts)\n\nNote: `fastForward` does not speed up an in-flight transactions.\n\nPro Tips\n========\n\n* `NEAR_WORKSPACES_DEBUG=true` – run tests with this environment variable set to get copious debug output and a full log file for each Sandbox instance.\n\n* `Worker.init` [config](https://github.com/near/workspaces-js/blob/main/packages/js/src/interfaces.ts) – you can pass a config object as the first argument to `Worker.init`. This lets you do things like:\n\n  * skip initialization if specified data directory already exists (the default behavior)\n\n    ```ts\n    Worker.init(\n      { rm: false, homeDir: './test-data/alice-owns-an-nft' },\n    )\n    ```\n\n  * always recreate such data directory instead with `rm: true`\n\n  * specify which port to run on\n\n  * and more!\n\nEnv variables\n========\n```text\nNEAR_CLI_MAINNET_RPC_SERVER_URL\nNEAR_CLI_TESTNET_RPC_SERVER_URL\n```\nClear them in case you want to get back to the default RPC server.\n\nExample:\n\n```shell\nexport NEAR_CLI_MAINNET_RPC_SERVER_URL=<put_your_rpc_server_url_here>\n```\nhere is a testcase: [jsonrpc.ava.js](./packages/js/__tests__/jsonrpc.ava.js)\n```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The provided code snippet from the NEAR repository's `README.md` explains functionalities available in Sandbox mode, particularly focusing on state manipulation for testing purposes. Let's break down the key points and concepts presented in the snippet:\n\n### On the Fly\n- **Sandbox Mode**: This mode is a testing environment that allows developers to quickly prototype and test their smart contracts without needing to deploy them on the main network.\n  \n- **`patchState`**: This functionality enables developers to add or modify the state of any contract, account, or access key directly. This is particularly useful in testing scenarios where you might want to simulate specific states or conditions without going through the normal transaction mechanisms.\n\n- **Arbitrary Mutation**: Normally, transactions in smart contracts are restricted by the contract's logic. For example, with an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) contract, you can only interact with NFTs that you own, as defined in the smart contract code. However, for testing purposes, you might want to alter the state of NFTs owned by other accounts. This is where `patchState` comes into play, allowing such operations without the constraints of the contract's business logic.\n\n- **Alternatives to `patchState`**: The snippet mentions another approach where you can dump the entire state, edit it, and then restart the node. However, this is more complex and disruptive since it requires stopping the node and changing the genesis state.\n\n- **Contract Code and Account Manipulation**: While `patchState` allows for extensive state changes, other actions like `DeployContract`, `CreateAccount`, and `AddKey` are limited to altering your own accounts or sub-accounts. This limitation is important for maintaining security in production environments.\n\n- **Example**: For further understanding, the README provides a link to a specific test that illustrates how to use `patchState`.\n\n### Time Traveling\n- **`fastForward`**: This function allows developers to manipulate time-sensitive states such as block height, timestamps, and epoch heights. This is useful for testing contracts that rely on time-based logic without having to wait for real-time blocks to be produced. \n\n- **Example**: A link is provided to a test that demonstrates how to use `fastForward`.\n\n- **Important Note**: `fastForward` does not affect in-flight transactions, meaning that it only influences the state of the blockchain but does not speed up any transactions that are currently being processed.\n\n### Pro Tips\n- **Debugging**: Setting the environment variable `NEAR_WORKSPACES_DEBUG=true` enables comprehensive logging for the sandbox, which is invaluable for debugging during development.\n\n- **Worker Configuration**: The `Worker.init` function can accept a configuration object that allows developers to:\n  - Control whether to remove existing data directories.\n  - Specify a custom port for running the sandbox.\n  - Other configuration options to customize the sandbox behavior.\n\n### Environment Variables\nThe snippet concludes with information about environment variables that can be used to set the RPC server URLs for NEAR CLI on different networks (mainnet and testnet). Clearing these variables restores the default configurations, which is useful for switching between different testing scenarios.\n\n### Example Usage\nAn example command is provided to set the `NEAR_CLI_MAINNET_RPC_SERVER_URL`, highlighting how to configure the environment for specific testing needs.\n\n### Summary\nThis section of the README serves as a guide for developers using the NEAR Protocol's Sandbox mode, providing crucial functionalities like state manipulation and time manipulation, alongside debugging tips and environment configurations, all aimed at enhancing the development and testing experience."}]}

Split storage allows nodes to reduce storage costs and improve block production performance by splitting local storage into two separate areas: a hot and a cold database .  The hot database is smaller in size and stores all of the data from the most recent epochs. The cold database is larger, and it stores all historical data for older epochs. Hot and cold databases can be independently placed on separate hardware storage, allowing configurations such as using hot storage on a fast NVMe drive, and placing cold storage on a cheaper HDD drive.\n\nIn split storage mode, the Near Client only works with a smaller hot database to produce blocks, which results in increased performance. Cold database is not accessed for reads during normal block production and is only read when historical data is specifically requested. Thus, we recommend keeping the cold database on cheaper and slower drives such as an HDD and only optimize speed for the hot database, which is about 10 times smaller.\n\nSplit storage is disabled by default, and can be enabled with a config change and going through a migration process that requires manual steps. We have several choices for the migration:\n* Use Pagoda-provided S3 snapshots of nodes that have split-storge configured.\n* Do a manual migration using S3 snapshots of the existing RPC single database\n* Do a manual migration using your own buddy RPC node\n\n| Migration option                                    | Pros                            | Cons                                                   |\n| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Pagoda-provided S3 snapshots of split-storage nodes | Fastest.

It is optimized for speed and is designed to be stored on faster hardware (e.g., NVMe SSDs).\n\n3. **Cold Database**:\n   - This larger database contains historical data from older epochs and can be stored on slower, cheaper storage (e.g., HDDs). Access to this database is minimized during normal operations, as it is only queried when historical data is needed.\n\n4. **Performance Benefits**:\n   - By limiting the operational load to the hot database, the system experiences improved performance during block production. As the cold database is not regularly accessed, it can be efficiently stored and managed.\n\n5. **Configuration**:\n   - Split storage is disabled by default. To enable it, users must modify their configuration and follow a migration process that may involve manual steps.\n\n### Migration Options\n\nThe document outlines three migration strategies for transitioning to split storage:\n\n| Migration Option                                    | Pros                            | Cons                                                   |\n| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Pagoda-provided S3 snapshots of split-storage nodes | Fastest. Little to no downtime. | Requires trust in migration performed by Pagoda nodes |\n| Manual migration + S3 RPC snapshots                 | No need for extra node. Cold storage is initialized in a trustless way. | Requires trust in Pagoda RPC snapshots. The node will be out of sync at the end of the migration and will need to block sync several epochs. Migration takes days and you cannot restart your node during that time. |\n| Manual migration + your own node                    | Trustless. Little to no downtime | Requires an extra RPC node with bigger storage. Migration takes days and you cannot restart your node during that time. |\n\n### Important Configuration Fields\n\nThe configuration JSON shown in the document is essential for setting up split storage. Here’s a breakdown of the fields:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"archive\": true, // Enables archival node settings\n    \"save_trie_changes\": <boolean>, // Whether to store Trie changes for garbage collection\n    \"store\": {\n      \"path\": <path to hot db, relative to NEAR home dir, defaults to \"data\"> // Path for hot database\n    },\n    \"cold_store\": { // Configuration for cold database if present\n      \"path\": <path to cold db, relative to NEAR home dir, defaults to \"cold-data\"> // Path for cold database\n    },\n    \"split_storage\": {\n      \"enable_split_storage_view_client\": <boolean> // Determines if the node acts as archival by querying cold storage\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Example Configuration\n\nAn example JSON configuration is provided to illustrate how to set up the split storage:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"archive\": true,\n  \"save_trie_changes\": true,\n  \"store\": {\n    \"path\": \"hot-data\" // Path for hot database\n  },\n  \"cold_store\": {\n    \"path\": \"cold-data\" // Path for cold database\n  },\n  \"split_storage\": {\n    \"enable_split_storage_view_client\": true // Enable querying cold storage\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Migration Using Pagoda-provided S3 Snapshots\n\nThe document also describes the prerequisites for using Pagoda-provided S3 snapshots, specifically the need for the `rclone` tool. This tool facilitates the downloading of snapshots from the cloud storage.\n\n1. **Installation of rclone**:\n   ```bash\n   $ sudo -v ; curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash\n   ```\n\n2. **Configuration of rclone**:\n   - The user is instructed to set up a configuration file for rclone to specify the details for accessing S3 storage.\n\n3. **Finding Latest Snapshot**:\n   - The user can use `rclone` commands to copy the data from the specified cloud storage location, allowing for a seamless transition to split storage.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe split storage feature in NEAR Protocol is a significant enhancement for archival nodes, allowing for better performance and cost efficiency. The document provides a comprehensive guide on the benefits, configurations, and migration strategies, ensuring that developers can effectively implement this feature in their NEAR nodes. \n\nBy adopting split storage, archival nodes can efficiently manage data storage while maintaining optimal performance during block production."}]}

It outlines methods for setting up a testing environment with either Docker containers or local execution for handling nodes. Let's break down the key components of the code for better understanding:\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n1. **Function Signatures**:\n   - The functions `docker`, `host`, and `run` are async functions that return a `Result` containing `Nodes`. This indicates that they perform asynchronous operations and can return results or errors.\n\n2. **Context Setup**:\n   - In both `docker` and `host` functions, a context (`ctx`) is established using `setup(docker_client).await?`. This context likely contains configurations or connections needed to manage the nodes.\n\n3. **MPC Recovery**:\n   - The code uses `mpc_recovery::generate(nodes)` to generate a set of public keys and secrets for the specified number of nodes. This is part of a multi-party computation (MPC) setup, where each node gets a share of the secret.\n\n4. **Signer Nodes Creation**:\n   - The loop iterates over the secrets, creating futures for each signer node:\n     ```rust\n     signer_node_futures.push(containers::SignerNode::run(&ctx, node_id, share, cipher_key));\n     ```\n   - The `run` function is likely responsible for starting each node, with parameters that include the context, node ID, and cryptographic shares.\n\n5. **Awaiting Results**:\n   - `futures::future::join_all(signer_node_futures).await` waits for all signer nodes to finish starting. The results are then collected into a `Vec<_>`, where `_` indicates that the exact type is not specified and is inferred.\n\n6. **Leader Node Creation**:\n   - After all signer nodes are running, a leader node is created based on the addresses of the signer nodes:\n     ```rust\n     let leader_node = containers::LeaderNode::run(&ctx, sign_nodes).await?;\n     ```\n\n7. **Node Types**:\n   - The `Nodes` enum (presumably defined elsewhere) can represent either a Docker setup or a local setup, as indicated by the `Ok(Nodes::Docker {...})` and `Ok(Nodes::Local {...})` return statements.\n\n8. **Conditional Compilation**:\n   - The `run` function uses conditional compilation with `#[cfg(feature = \"docker-test\")]` to decide whether to invoke the `docker` function or the `host` function. This allows the code to be compiled differently based on the presence of the `docker-test` feature flag.\n\n### Example of Usage\n\nHere's a high-level example to illustrate how you might call the `run` function:\n\n```rust\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {\n    let docker_client = DockerClient::new(); // Assume a valid Docker client is created\n    let nodes = 5; // Number of nodes to set up\n    let result = run(nodes, &docker_client).await?;\n\n    // Handle the result, which contains information about the nodes\n    println!(\"{:?}\", result);\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\n### Summary\n\nThe provided code is a part of a testing framework that allows for flexible node setups for integration testing in the NEAR Protocol. It supports both Docker-based and local setups, facilitating efficient testing and development of decentralized applications. The use of asynchronous programming with futures ensures that the execution is non-blocking, which is essential for performance in a blockchain context.\n\nIf you have further questions or need additional explanations about specific parts of the code, feel free to ask!"}]}

Let's break down the components of the code to understand its functionality and purpose.\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n```typescript\nimport { expect, Page } from 'playwright/test';\n```\n- This line imports `expect` and `Page` from the Playwright testing library. \n  - `expect` is an assertion function that provides a way to verify that a certain condition is true.\n  - `Page` is a type that represents a page in a browser context, allowing interactions and manipulations of the web page during testing.\n\n```typescript\nimport { TIMEOUT } from './constants';\n```\n- This line imports a constant named `TIMEOUT` from a local `constants` module. This constant likely defines a default timeout value used in the tests (e.g., how long to wait for an element to appear).\n\n```typescript\nexport const expectToExist = async (page: Page, text: string, timeout = TIMEOUT) => {\n```\n- This line defines and exports an asynchronous function `expectToExist`. The function takes three parameters:\n  - `page`: an instance of the `Page` type from Playwright, representing the current page in the browser.\n  - `text`: a string that represents the text content to look for within the page.\n  - `timeout`: an optional parameter that specifies how long to wait for the text to appear. If not provided, it defaults to the value of `TIMEOUT`.\n\n```typescript\n  await expect(page.getByText(text)).toHaveText(text, { timeout });\n```\n- This line performs the core functionality of the function:\n  - `page.getByText(text)`: This method searches the page for an element that contains the specified `text`. It returns a locator for that element.\n  - `expect(...).toHaveText(text, { timeout })`: This assertion checks whether the found element has the specified `text`. If the text does not appear within the specified `timeout`, the test will fail.\n  - The use of `await` ensures that the function waits for the text check to complete before proceeding, making sure that the text either exists within the timeout period or throws an error if it does not.\n\n### Purpose\nThe `expectToExist` function is a reusable utility designed for E2E tests. It encapsulates the logic to check for the existence of a specific text on a web page, providing a straightforward way to validate that certain content is rendered correctly. This is particularly useful in testing scenarios where you want to confirm that a page displays the correct information after a user action or an API call.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, this code snippet provides a utility function for Playwright tests that verifies the presence of a specified text on a web page within a given timeout. This function enhances the readability and maintainability of test code by encapsulating the assertion logic, making it easier to use throughout the test suite."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain the following code snippet from NEAR repository file `packages/utils/src/errors/errors.ts`:\n```import ErrorMessagesJson from './error_messages.json';\n\nexport const ErrorMessages: { [error: string]: string } = ErrorMessagesJson;\n```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the provided code snippet from the NEAR repository, we can break it down into its components for a clearer understanding:\n\n```typescript\nimport ErrorMessagesJson from './error_messages.json';\n```\n### Explanation:\n- **Importing JSON Data**: This line imports a JSON file named `error_messages.json` that is located in the same directory as the current TypeScript file (`errors.ts`). The imported data is assigned to the variable `ErrorMessagesJson`.\n  \n- **Purpose of the JSON File**: Typically, such a JSON file would contain structured data, in this case likely a mapping of error codes or messages to their human-readable text equivalents. This allows for easy localization and management of error messages used throughout the codebase.\n\n```typescript\nexport const ErrorMessages: { [error: string]: string } = ErrorMessagesJson;\n```\n### Explanation:\n- **Exporting a Constant**: This line exports a constant named `ErrorMessages`, making it available for import in other modules/files. This is useful for centralized error handling across the application.\n\n- **Type Definition**: The type definition `{ [error: string]: string }` specifies that `ErrorMessages` is an object where each key (representing an error code or identifier) is a string, and each corresponding value (the human-readable error message) is also a string. This is a TypeScript feature that provides type safety, ensuring that the keys and values adhere to the specified structure.\n\n- **Assignment**: The `ErrorMessages` constant is assigned the value of `ErrorMessagesJson`, which means it directly takes the data from the imported JSON file. This allows developers to access error messages easily by referring to the appropriate keys.\n\n### Summary:\nIn summary, this snippet serves to import error messages from a JSON file and export them as a typed constant for use throughout the NEAR application. It facilitates error handling by centralizing error messages in a manageable format, enhancing maintainability and localization efforts."}]}

It outlines key functionalities such as attaching an NFT to a call, approving users for NFT transfers, listing NFTs for sale, and buying NFTs. Below is a breakdown of each section for clarity:\n\n### Attaching an NFT to a Call\n\n1. **Calling `nft_transfer_call`:**\n   - This function is invoked on the NFT contract to transfer an NFT to a specified receiver. It requires three parameters:\n     - `receiver`: The account that will receive the NFT.\n     - `msg`: An optional message that can carry additional information.\n     - `token-id`: The unique identifier of the NFT being transferred.\n\n2. **NFT Transfer Process:**\n   - Upon calling `nft_transfer_call`, the NFT contract transfers the NFT to the specified receiver.\n\n3. **Calling `nft_on_transfer`:**\n   - After the transfer, the NFT contract invokes the `nft_on_transfer` method on the receiver contract, passing in:\n     - `sender`: The account which sent the NFT.\n     - `token-owner`: The current owner of the NFT before the transfer.\n     - `token-id`: The id of the transferred NFT.\n     - `msg`: Any additional parameters sent along with the transfer.\n   - This allows the receiver contract to handle the NFT appropriately based on its business logic.\n\n4. **Error Handling:**\n   - The NFT contract must manage any errors that arise during the transfer process through a callback function called `nft_resolve_transfer`.\n\n5. **Return Value:**\n   - The `nft_on_transfer` method must return `true` if the NFT should be returned to the sender. This establishes a mechanism for the receiver contract to indicate whether it successfully handled the NFT transfer.\n\n### Approving Users\n\n- Users can authorize other accounts to transfer an NFT they own. This is particularly useful for interactions with marketplaces where you might want to list your NFT for sale. \n- The `nft_approve` method is called to set this authorization, which includes the token ID, the account being authorized, and an optional message.\n\n#### Command-Line Interface (CLI) Example\n```bash\nnear call <nft-contract> nft_approve '{\n  \"token_id\": \"<token-unique-id>\",\n  \"account_id\": \"<authorized-account>\",\n  \"msg\": \"<json-structure>\"\n}' --accountId <your-account> --depositYocto 1\n```\n- The `msg` parameter, if provided, triggers a call to `<authorized_account>.nft_on_approve(msg)`, leading to a callback to `nft_resolve_transfer` in the NFT contract.\n\n### Listing an NFT for Sale\n\n- Basic NFT contracts do not include marketplace functionality by default and rely on external applications (e.g., Paras or Mintbase) to handle listings.\n- To sell an NFT, two main actions are required:\n  1. Covering data storage costs in the marketplace contract.\n  2. Approving the marketplace to sell the NFT by calling the appropriate methods on the NFT contract.\n\n### Buying an NFT\n\n- Similar to listing, buying an NFT typically occurs through ecosystem applications that integrate with the NFT contracts. The documentation provides various methods (like components and CLI) for buying NFTs.\n\n### Additional Resources\n\n- The documentation links to a tutorial section that provides hands-on examples for creating NFTs using JavaScript SDK, which can be beneficial for developers new to the NEAR ecosystem.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis documentation provides critical insights into how NFTs operate within the NEAR Protocol, highlighting the importance of cross-contract interactions and the need for proper error handling. Developers can leverage this knowledge to build robust applications that utilize NFTs effectively."}]}

Below, I will explain each section in detail.\n\n### Code Snippet Breakdown\n\n1. **Node.js Installation**:\n   ```bash\n   https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_17.x | sudo -E bash -  \n   sudo apt install build-essential nodejs\n   ```\n   - This command fetches and runs a script to set up the NodeSource repository for Node.js version 17.x. The `-E` flag preserves the user's environment variables for the command run with `sudo`.\n   - After the setup, `sudo apt install build-essential nodejs` installs Node.js along with the `build-essential` package, which includes packages required for compiling software (like `gcc`, `g++`, `make`, etc.).\n\n2. **Check Node.js and npm Version**:\n   ```bash\n   node -v  # Outputs Node.js version\n   npm -v   # Outputs npm version\n   ```\n   - These commands check the installed versions of Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager), ensuring they are correctly installed and displaying their versions.\n\n3. **Install NEAR-CLI**:\n   ```bash\n   sudo npm install -g near-cli\n   ```\n   - This command installs the NEAR Command Line Interface (NEAR-CLI) globally using npm. The `-g` flag makes it accessible from anywhere in the terminal. The use of `sudo` ensures that the binary is placed in `/usr/local/bin`, which is typically included in the system's executable path.\n\n### Validator Stats Commands\n\n- **Set Environment**: \n   ```bash\n   export NEAR_ENV=<network>\n   ```\n   - This command sets the environment variable `NEAR_ENV` to specify which NEAR network to interact with (GuildNet, TestNet, or MainNet).\n\n- **Proposals**:\n   ```bash\n   near proposals\n   ```\n   - This command retrieves proposals from validators who wish to join the validator set. It checks if they meet the minimum seat price required.\n\n- **Current Validators**:\n   ```bash\n   near validators current\n   ```\n   - This command shows the list of active validators in the current epoch, including the number of blocks they produced, expected blocks, and their online status.\n\n- **Next Validators**:\n   ```bash\n   near validators next\n   ```\n   - This command lists validators whose proposals were accepted in the previous epoch, indicating they will enter the validator set in the next epoch.\n\n### Additional Sections\n\n- **Setup of a Validator**: This section outlines the steps for setting up a validator node, including hardware requirements, installing developer tools, and configuring the environment.\n\n- **Server Requirements**: It specifies the minimum hardware needed for block-producing validators and chunk-only producers.\n\n- **Installing Developer Tools**:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt install -y git binutils-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev zlib1g-dev libdw-dev libiberty-dev cmake gcc g++ python docker.io protobuf-compiler libssl-dev pkg-config clang llvm cargo\n   ```\n   - This command installs various essential developer tools and libraries required for compiling and running NEAR Protocol's software.\n\n- **Installing Rust**:\n   ```bash\n   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh\n   ```\n   - This command downloads and installs Rust, a programming language needed for building NEAR's core software.\n\n- **Clone `nearcore` Project**:\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/near/nearcore\n   ```\n   - This command clones the NEAR core repository from GitHub, allowing developers to access the codebase and compile it for the NEAR blockchain.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe entire guide serves as a comprehensive tutorial for setting up a NEAR validator node, starting from installing necessary software and dependencies, to interacting with the NEAR blockchain via NEAR-CLI. It emphasizes the importance of proper environment setup and hardware requirements to ensure optimal performance as a validator."}]}

Let's break down the key components and functionality of the code piece by piece.\n\n### Module Declarations\n\n```rust\npub mod containers;\npub mod execute;\npub mod local;\npub mod utils;\n```\n\nHere, several modules are declared:\n- **containers**: Likely contains definitions for containerized environments (e.g., using Docker).\n- **execute**: Presumably handles execution logic related to tests or node operations.\n- **local**: Deals with local node configurations and operations.\n- **utils**: Contains utility functions or types used throughout the code.\n\n### Imports\n\n```rust\nuse std::collections::HashMap;\nuse self::local::NodeConfig;\nuse crate::containers::DockerClient;\nuse crate::containers::LocalStack;\n\nuse anyhow::Context as _;\nuse bollard::exec::{CreateExecOptions, StartExecResults};\nuse futures::StreamExt;\nuse mpc_contract::config::{PresignatureConfig, ProtocolConfig, TripleConfig};\nuse mpc_contract::primitives::CandidateInfo;\nuse mpc_node::gcp::GcpService;\nuse mpc_node::storage;\nuse mpc_node::storage::triple_storage::TripleNodeStorageBox;\nuse near_crypto::KeyFile;\nuse near_workspaces::network::{Sandbox, ValidatorKey};\nuse near_workspaces::{Account, AccountId, Contract, Worker};\nuse serde_json::json;\nuse testcontainers::{Container, GenericImage};\n```\n\nThis section imports several libraries and modules:\n- Standard and external libraries for collections, error handling (`anyhow`), asynchronous programming (`futures`), and JSON handling (`serde_json`).\n- Specific modules from the `mpc_contract` and `mpc_node` crates for managing multi-party computation (MPC) configurations and storage.\n- NEAR Protocol-related types and utilities, such as `Account`, `Contract`, and `Worker`, which are essential for interacting with NEAR smart contracts.\n- `testcontainers` for managing Docker containers in tests.\n\n### Constants\n\n```rust\nconst NETWORK: &str = \"mpc_it_network\";\n```\n\nA constant string `NETWORK` is defined, likely representing the name of the network used during testing.\n\n### Struct Definition\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Clone, Debug)]\npub struct MultichainConfig {\n    pub nodes: usize,\n    pub threshold: usize,\n    pub protocol: ProtocolConfig,\n}\n```\n\n`MultichainConfig` is a struct that holds configuration parameters for the multi-chain testing setup:\n- `nodes`: The number of nodes in the configuration.\n- `threshold`: The minimum number of nodes required to reach consensus.\n- `protocol`: An instance of `ProtocolConfig`, which defines various protocol-specific parameters.\n\n### Default Implementation\n\n```rust\nimpl Default for MultichainConfig {\n    fn default() -> Self {\n        Self {\n            nodes: 3,\n            threshold: 2,\n            protocol: ProtocolConfig {\n                triple: TripleConfig {\n                    min_triples: 8,\n                    max_triples: 80,\n                    ..Default::default()\n                },\n                presignature: PresignatureConfig {\n                    min_presignatures: 2,\n                    max_presignatures: 20,\n                    ..Default::default()\n                },\n                ..Default::default()\n            },\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation provides default values for the `MultichainConfig` struct. It sets the default number of nodes to 3, a threshold of 2, and initializes the `ProtocolConfig` with specific values for `TripleConfig` and `PresignatureConfig`.\n\n### Enum Definition\n\n```rust\npub enum Nodes<'a> {\n    Local {\n        ctx: Context<'a>,\n        nodes: Vec<local::Node>,\n    },\n    Docker {\n        ctx: Context<'a>,\n        nodes: Vec<containers::Node<'a>>,\n    },\n}\n```\n\nThe `Nodes` enum represents two types of node management:\n- **Local**: For managing nodes running in a local environment.\n- **Docker**: For managing nodes running in Docker containers.\n\nEach variant contains a context (`ctx`) and a vector of nodes.\n\n### Methods\n\nThe `Nodes` enum implements several methods:\n\n- **len**: Returns the number of nodes in the respective environment.\n- **is_empty**: Checks if there are any nodes present.\n- **ctx**: Retrieves the context associated with the nodes.\n- **url**: Returns the URL of a specific node by its index.\n- **near_accounts**: Collects and returns the NEAR accounts associated with the nodes.\n\n#### Starting a Node\n\n```rust\npub async fn start_node(\n    &mut self,\n    cfg: &MultichainConfig,\n    new_account: &Account,\n) -> anyhow::Result<()> {\n    tracing::info!(id = %new_account.id(), \"adding one more node\");\n    match self {\n        Nodes::Local { ctx, nodes } => {\n            nodes.push(local::Node::run(ctx, cfg, new_account).await?)\n        }\n        Nodes::Docker { ctx, nodes } => {\n            nodes.push(containers::Node::run(ctx, cfg, new_account).await?)\n        }\n    }\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\nThis asynchronous function starts a new node based on the configuration provided. It logs the action and calls the appropriate method to run a node, whether local or Docker-based.\n\n#### Killing a Node\n\n```rust\npub async fn kill_node(&mut self, account_id: &AccountId) -> NodeConfig {\n    let killed_node_config = match self {\n        Nodes::Local { nodes, .. } => {\n            let index = nodes\n                .iter()\n                .position(|node| node.account.id() == account_id)\n                .unwrap();\n            nodes.remove(index).kill()\n        }\n        Nodes::Docker { nodes, .. } => {\n            let index = nodes\n                .iter()\n                .position(|node| node.account.id() == account_id)\n                .unwrap();\n            nodes.remove(index).kill()\n        }\n    };\n\n    // wait for the node to be removed from the network\n    tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(1)).await;\n\n    killed_node_config\n}\n```\n\nThis function removes a node from the network using its account ID. It waits for a short duration to ensure the node is fully removed before returning the configuration of the killed node.\n\n#### Restarting a Node\n\n```rust\npub async fn restart_node(&mut self, config: NodeConfig) -> anyhow::Result<()> {\n    tracing::info!(node_account_id = %config.account.id(), \"restarting node\");\n    match self {\n        Nodes::Local { ctx, nodes } => nodes.push(local::Node::spawn(ctx, config)\n```\n\nThis function restarts a node using its configuration. It logs the action and manages the restarting process depending on whether it’s a local or Docker node.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe provided code snippet establishes a robust framework for managing nodes in a multi-chain integration testing context for the NEAR Protocol. It defines configurations, manages both local and Docker-based nodes, and provides essential operations like starting, killing, and restarting nodes. The use of asynchronous programming and logging enhances the overall functionality and debuggability of the integration testing process."}]}

Let's break it down step-by-step to understand its components and functionality.\n\n### Struct Definition\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Debug, Clone)]\npub struct Base64Bytes {\n    inner: Vec<u8>, // This field holds the byte vector representation of the base64-decoded data.\n}\n```\n- The `Base64Bytes` struct is defined to encapsulate a vector of bytes (`Vec<u8>`) that represents data decoded from a Base64 string.\n- The `#[derive(Debug, Clone)]` attribute allows instances of `Base64Bytes` to be formatted using the `Debug` trait and cloned, which is often useful for debugging and managing ownership.\n\n### Trait Implementations\n\n#### `interactive_clap::ToCli`\n\n```rust\nimpl interactive_clap::ToCli for Base64Bytes {\n    type CliVariant = Base64Bytes; // Specifies the CLI variant type.\n}\n```\n- This implementation allows `Base64Bytes` to be used with the `interactive_clap` library, which provides command-line interface (CLI) functionalities.\n- The `CliVariant` type is defined as `Base64Bytes`, indicating that the CLI representation of this struct is the struct itself.\n\n#### `std::str::FromStr`\n\n```rust\nimpl std::str::FromStr for Base64Bytes {\n    type Err = String; // Defines the error type for parsing.\n\n    fn from_str(s: &str) -> Result<Self, Self::Err> {\n        Ok(Self {\n            inner: near_primitives::serialize::from_base64(s).map_err(|err| {\n                format!(\n                    \"parsing action {s} failed due to invalid base64 sequence: {}\",\n                    err\n                )\n            })?,\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n- This implementation allows `Base64Bytes` to be created from a `&str`. It requires the string to be a valid Base64 encoded representation of bytes.\n- The `from_base64` function from `near_primitives::serialize` is called to decode the Base64 string:\n  - If the decoding fails, it maps the error to a more informative string indicating what went wrong during parsing.\n- On success, it wraps the resulting byte vector in `Ok(Self { ... })`.\n\n#### `std::fmt::Display`\n\n```rust\nimpl std::fmt::Display for Base64Bytes {\n    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut std::fmt::Formatter<'_>) -> std::fmt::Result {\n        write!(f, \"{}\", near_primitives::serialize::to_base64(&self.inner))\n    }\n}\n```\n- This implementation allows `Base64Bytes` instances to be formatted as strings, which is useful for printing or logging.\n- It converts the internal byte vector back to a Base64 string using the `to_base64` function from `near_primitives::serialize` and writes it to the provided formatter.\n\n### Additional Methods\n\n```rust\nimpl Base64Bytes {\n    pub fn as_bytes(&self) -> &[u8] {\n        &self.inner // Returns a slice of the inner byte vector.\n    }\n\n    pub fn into_bytes(self) -> Vec<u8> {\n        self.inner // Consumes the Base64Bytes instance and returns the inner byte vector.\n    }\n}\n```\n- **`as_bytes` Method**: Returns a reference to the byte slice of the inner vector, allowing read access without taking ownership.\n- **`into_bytes` Method**: Consumes the `Base64Bytes` instance and returns the underlying byte vector, transferring ownership to the caller.\n\n### Summary\nThis snippet provides a structured way to handle Base64 encoded byte data in Rust. The `Base64Bytes` struct encapsulates the byte data, and the implementations for `FromStr` and `Display` traits enable easy conversion and representation of Base64 data. The additional methods provide utility functions for interacting with the byte data, either by borrowing or consuming it. This is particularly useful in blockchain applications where data serialization and deserialization play a crucial role."}]}

Below, I will break down the key components of the snippet and explain their significance within the context of developing and deploying NEAR smart contracts.\n\n### Explanation of the Code Snippet\n\n1. **Testing the Contract**:\n   ```bash\n   yarn test\n   ```\n   This command is used to run tests defined in the JavaScript/TypeScript project. It typically executes any unit tests that have been written to verify the functionality of the smart contract or related code. The usage of `yarn` indicates that the project is managed with Yarn, a package manager for JavaScript.\n\n   ```bash\n   cd contract-rs\n   cargo test\n   ```\n   In this command, you navigate to the directory containing the Rust smart contract (`contract-rs`) and run `cargo test`. `Cargo` is the Rust package manager, and this command will compile the contract and execute any tests defined within it. This is crucial for ensuring that the contract behaves as expected before deployment.\n\n2. **Integration Tests**:\n   The note:\n   ```markdown\n   :::tip\n   The `integration tests` use a sandbox to create NEAR users and simulate interactions with the contract.\n   :::\n   ```\n   This indicates that integration tests are set up to simulate real-world interactions with the smart contract. A sandbox environment is typically used to safely test the contract without affecting the main network, allowing developers to create NEAR users and run transactions similar to production conditions.\n\n3. **Deploying the Contract**:\n   The section on deploying the contract describes the steps involved in creating a NEAR account and deploying the smart contract:\n   ```bash\n   near create-account <accountId> --useFaucet\n   ```\n   This command creates a new NEAR account using funds from a faucet, which is a service that provides tokens for development purposes.\n\n   The subsequent commands:\n   ```bash\n   cargo near build\n   cargo near deploy <accountId>\n   ```\n   These commands build the smart contract using Cargo and deploy it to the specified NEAR account. This is a critical step before any interactions can occur with the smart contract.\n\n4. **Interacting with the Contract**:\n   The tutorial provides commands for interacting with the deployed smart contract:\n   - **Get Current Number**:\n     ```bash\n     near view counter.near-examples.testnet get_num\n     ```\n     This command queries the current state of the counter in the smart contract, invoking a read-only function.\n\n   - **Increment the Counter**:\n     ```bash\n     near call counter.near-examples.testnet increment --accountId <accountId>\n     ```\n     This command calls the `increment` method on the smart contract, effectively increasing the counter's value. The `--accountId` flag specifies which account is performing the transaction.\n\n   - **Decrement and Reset the Counter**:\n     Similar commands are provided to decrement the counter and reset it to zero, demonstrating how to interact with the contract's state.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis code snippet from the NEAR protocol repository covers essential aspects of testing, deploying, and interacting with a smart contract. It emphasizes the importance of both unit and integration testing, outlines the steps to create a NEAR account, and provides examples of how to perform various operations on a smart contract. This material is crucial for developers looking to build and deploy decentralized applications on the NEAR platform. \n\nIf you have any specific questions about any part of this snippet or need further clarification, feel free to ask!"}]}

Let's break down the code and its context for clarity.\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n```typescript\n/**\n * Retrieves the current gas price at a specific block height or block hash.\n * @see [https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/gas](https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/gas)\n *\n * @param blockId Block hash or height, or null for latest.\n */\nasync gasPrice(blockId: BlockId | null): Promise<GasPrice> {\n    return this.withBackoff((currentProvider) => currentProvider.gasPrice(blockId));\n}\n```\n\n#### 1. **Function Purpose**\n- The `gasPrice` function is designed to return the current gas price on the NEAR blockchain. Gas prices are essential for determining the cost of executing transactions or smart contracts on the blockchain.\n\n#### 2. **Parameters**\n- `blockId`: This parameter can either be:\n  - A specific block hash or block height (to get the gas price at that particular state of the blockchain).\n  - `null`, which indicates that the latest gas price should be retrieved.\n\n#### 3. **Return Type**\n- The function returns a `Promise<GasPrice>`, indicating that it is asynchronous and will eventually resolve to an instance of `GasPrice`. This is a type that represents the gas price information.\n\n#### 4. **Backoff Mechanism**\n- The function utilizes a method called `withBackoff`. This is likely a utility that helps manage retries when communicating with the RPC provider. If the first attempt to get the gas price fails (perhaps due to network issues or the provider being down), `withBackoff` will automatically retry the request according to a specific strategy (like exponential backoff).\n  \n- The argument `(currentProvider) => currentProvider.gasPrice(blockId)` is a callback function that takes the current provider instance and calls its `gasPrice` method with the `blockId` parameter. This encapsulates the logic of fetching the gas price from the current provider.\n\n### Contextual Understanding\n- **Failover RPC Provider**: The surrounding class likely implements a failover strategy for connecting to multiple RPC providers. If one provider fails to respond or is slow, it can automatically switch to another, ensuring the application remains resilient and responsive.\n\n- **Gas Price Importance**: In blockchain environments, gas prices fluctuate based on network demand. By allowing users to specify a block ID, the function enables fetching historical gas prices, which can be crucial for applications that need to simulate transactions or for audits.\n\n### Summary\nOverall, this code snippet is a well-structured asynchronous method that retrieves the gas price from a blockchain provider with built-in error handling via a backoff strategy. This is essential for dApps operating in a decentralized environment where reliability and performance are critical."}]}

Using a set ensures that each account is unique, as sets do not allow duplicate values.\n\n2. **Return the result**:\n    ```javascript\n    return Array.from(result);\n    ```\n\n    - After collecting all the accounts into the `result` set, this line converts the set into an array using `Array.from()`.\n    - The use of an array allows for easier manipulation and access of the accounts later in the code, as arrays are more commonly used for iteration and indexing.\n\n3. **toString method**:\n    ```javascript\n    toString(): string {\n        return `MergeKeyStore(${this.keyStores.join(', ')})`;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    - This method overrides the default `toString()` method for the class.\n    - It provides a string representation of the `MergeKeyStore` instance, which includes a list of the key stores being merged.\n    - The `this.keyStores.join(', ')` part takes the array of key stores and concatenates them into a single string, separated by commas. This is useful for debugging and logging, as it gives a clear view of the key stores that are part of this merged key store.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, this code snippet is part of a mechanism to manage multiple key stores within the NEAR ecosystem. It retrieves accounts from a specific key store, ensures uniqueness using a set, and provides a helpful string representation of the merged key store for better visibility and debugging. This is particularly useful in applications where multiple key management strategies are required, such as in wallets or decentralized applications (dApps)."}]}

This document outlines the guidelines and processes for contributing to the project, which is structured as a monorepository using the NX toolchain. Below, I'll break down the main components of the document and explain their significance.\n\n### Key Sections of the `CONTRIBUTING.md` File\n\n1. **Monorepository Structure**:\n   ```markdown\n   This project is using an [NX](https://nx.dev) style [monorepository](https://monorepo.tools) that helps divide and map the project dependencies for each project.\n   ```\n   - **Explanation**: This project uses NX, a set of extensible dev tools for monorepos. A monorepo allows multiple projects to share code and dependencies more efficiently, simplifying the management of interdependent projects.\n\n2. **Directory Structure**:\n   ```markdown\n   The core modules are in the `packages` directory and the example apps are in the `examples` directory.\n   ```\n   - **Explanation**: The organization of the code is crucial for developers to locate core modules and example applications easily. Core modules are typically the main components of the project, while examples showcase how to use these components.\n\n3. **Running Commands**:\n   ```markdown\n   On the other hand, if you want to run a specific command in a package, you can use the `nx run` command.\n   ```\n   - **Explanation**: The document explains how to use the NX command-line tool to run specific tasks defined in a project’s configuration file (`project.json`). This flexibility allows developers to execute commands tailored to their needs.\n\n4. **Building and Running Examples**:\n   ```bash\n   yarn build:all # builds all packages\n   yarn nx serve react # run the react example\n   yarn nx serve angular # run the angular example\n   ```\n   - **Explanation**: These commands guide developers on how to build all packages and run specific example applications. This step is essential for testing changes locally before committing them.\n\n5. **Rebuilding Packages**:\n   ```markdown\n   Note: [`modal-ui`](/packages/modal-ui) package must be re-build after every change in the source files of this package `yarn nx run modal-ui:build`\n   ```\n   - **Explanation**: This note emphasizes the importance of rebuilding certain packages after changes to ensure that the application reflects the latest modifications. \n\n6. **Pull Request (PR) Submission**:\n   ```markdown\n   For your PR to be considered, you must select a template, include details, and make the appropriate selections from the checkboxes provided.\n   ```\n   - **Explanation**: This section outlines the PR submission process, ensuring that contributors provide necessary context and follow a standardized format, which helps maintain clarity and organization in the review process.\n\n7. **Branching Strategy**:\n   ```markdown\n   In this project there are two important branches `main` and `dev` branch. Pushing or committing directly in these two branches is forbidden.\n   ```\n   - **Explanation**: The document specifies a branching strategy where direct commits to the `main` and `dev` branches are forbidden. This practice helps maintain the integrity of the codebase, ensuring that only reviewed and tested code is merged into these critical branches.\n\n8. **Release Process**:\n   ```markdown\n   Once the planned work has been finished and the set date has arrived a merge request from `dev` to `main` should be made.\n   ```\n   - **Explanation**: This section describes the process of merging changes from the development branch to the main branch, highlighting the importance of orderly releases and versioning.\n\n9. **Wallet Listing Criteria**:\n   ```markdown\n   A wallet project must implement and comply with the following product criteria to be listed on the Wallet Selector:\n   ```\n   - **Explanation**: This part outlines the criteria that wallet projects must meet to be included in the Wallet Selector. It covers both product and security criteria, ensuring that only compliant and secure wallets are listed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe `CONTRIBUTING.md` file serves as a comprehensive guide for developers looking to contribute to the project. It establishes clear expectations for project structure, development practices, and submission protocols, ultimately facilitating a smoother collaboration process and maintaining high standards for contributions. By following these guidelines, contributors can help ensure the project's success and integrity within the NEAR ecosystem."}]}

Below, I will break down the key components of this snippet and explain their functionality.\n\n### Overview of the `UnorderedMap` Methods\n\n#### 1. `clear`\n\n```rust\npub fn clear(&mut self)\nwhere\n    K: BorshDeserialize + Clone,\n    V: BorshDeserialize,\n{\n    for k in self.keys.drain() {\n        // Set instead of remove to avoid loading the value from storage.\n        self.values.set(k, None);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: The `clear` method removes all entries from the `UnorderedMap`.\n- **Parameters**: \n  - `&mut self`: A mutable reference to the `UnorderedMap` instance.\n- **Functionality**:\n  - The method iterates over all keys in the internal storage (`self.keys`), and for each key, it sets its corresponding value in `self.values` to `None`. This effectively marks the entry as removed without needing to load the value from storage, optimizing performance.\n- **Constraints**: The generic types `K` (key) and `V` (value) must implement the `BorshDeserialize` trait, and `K` must also implement `Clone`.\n\n#### 2. `iter`\n\n```rust\npub fn iter(&self) -> Iter<K, V, H>\nwhere\n    K: BorshDeserialize,\n{\n    Iter::new(self)\n}\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: Returns an iterator over the key-value pairs in the `UnorderedMap`.\n- **Returns**: An instance of `Iter<K, V, H>`, which is a struct representing the iterator.\n- **Usage**: This method allows looping over the entries in an arbitrary order.\n\n#### 3. `iter_mut`\n\n```rust\npub fn iter_mut(&mut self) -> IterMut<K, V, H>\nwhere\n    K: BorshDeserialize,\n{\n    IterMut::new(self)\n}\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: Returns a mutable iterator over the key-value pairs.\n- **Returns**: An instance of `IterMut<K, V, H>`.\n- **Usage**: This allows modifying the values in place while iterating over the entries.\n\n#### 4. `keys`\n\n```rust\npub fn keys(&self) -> Keys<K>\nwhere\n    K: BorshDeserialize,\n{\n    Keys::new(self)\n}\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: Returns an iterator over the keys in the `UnorderedMap`.\n- **Returns**: An instance of `Keys<K>`, an iterator specifically for keys.\n- **Usage**: This is useful for accessing all keys without needing to access their corresponding values.\n\n#### 5. `values`\n\n```rust\npub fn values(&self) -> Values<K, V, H>\nwhere\n    K: BorshDeserialize,\n{\n    Values::new(self)\n}\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: Returns an iterator over the values in the `UnorderedMap`.\n- **Returns**: An instance of `Values<K, V, H>`, which provides access to the values.\n- **Usage**: This allows iterating through all stored values.\n\n#### 6. `values_mut`\n\n```rust\npub fn values_mut(&mut self) -> ValuesMut<K, V, H>\nwhere\n    K: BorshDeserialize,\n{\n    ValuesMut::new(self)\n}\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: Returns a mutable iterator over the values in the `UnorderedMap`.\n- **Returns**: An instance of `ValuesMut<K, V, H>`.\n- **Usage**: This allows modifying the values directly during iteration.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\nThe code snippets included in comments demonstrate how to use each method effectively:\n\n1. **Clearing the Map**:\n   ```rust\n   let mut map: UnorderedMap<String, u8> = UnorderedMap::new(b\"b\");\n   map.insert(\"a\".to_string(), 1);\n   map.clear();\n   assert!(map.is_empty());\n   ```\n\n2. **Iterating Over Key-Value Pairs**:\n   ```rust\n   for (key, val) in map.iter() {\n       println!(\"key: {} val: {}\", key, val);\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Mutable Iteration for Updating Values**:\n   ```rust\n   for (_, val) in map.iter_mut() {\n       *val *= 2; // Doubles the value\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Iterating Over Keys and Values**:\n   ```rust\n   for key in map.keys() {\n       println!(\"{}\", key);\n   }\n   for val in map.values() {\n       println!(\"{}\", val);\n   }\n   ```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe `UnorderedMap` implementation in the NEAR SDK provides several utilities for managing collections of key-value pairs. The methods `clear`, `iter`, `iter_mut`, `keys`, and `values` facilitate efficient data management and retrieval while adhering to Rust's safety and performance principles. The examples provided enhance understanding by showing practical applications of each method."}]}

If a toast with the passed `id` is currently open, a new toast will not be opened:\n\n```tsx\n<Button\n  onClick={() =>\n    openToast({\n      id: 'my-unique-toast',\n      title: 'Toast Title',\n      description: 'This is a great toast description.',\n    })\n  }\n>\n  Deduplicated Toast\n</Button>\n```\n\n## Custom Toast\n\nIf you need something more custom, you can render a custom toast using `lib/Toast/Toaster.tsx` as an example like so:\n\n```tsx\nimport * as Toast from '@/components/lib/Toast';\n\n...\n\n<Toast.Provider duration={5000}>\n  <Toast.Root open={isOpen} onOpenChange={setIsOpen}>\n    <Toast.Title>My Title</Toast.Title>\n    <Toast.Description>My Description</Toast.Description>\n    <Toast.CloseButton />\n  </Toast.Root>\n\n  <Toast.Viewport />\n</Toast.Provider>\n```\n```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The provided code snippet from the NEAR repository's `Toast` component documentation describes how to implement and use toast notifications in a React application using Radix UI primitives. Below, I will break down the key components and functionalities outlined in the code:\n\n### Overview of Toast Component\n\n**Toast** is a user interface pattern used to show brief messages to users, typically appearing at the corner of the screen. It's often used for notifications about actions taken or errors encountered.\n\n### Implementation Details\n\n1. **Radix Primitives**:\n   - The toast component is built using [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/components/toast) primitives, which are accessible and customizable components that adhere to best practices in UI development.\n\n### Example of Using `openToast`\n\nThe `openToast` function is the main API for triggering toast notifications from anywhere in the application. Here’s a breakdown of how to use it:\n\n#### Basic Usage\n\n```tsx\nimport { openToast } from '@/components/lib/Toast';\n\n<Button\n  onClick={() =>\n    openToast({\n      type: 'ERROR',\n      title: 'Toast Title',\n      description: 'This is a great toast description.',\n    })\n  }\n>\n  Open a Toast\n</Button>\n```\n\n- **Import**: The `openToast` function is imported from the Toast module.\n- **Button Component**: When the button is clicked, it triggers the `openToast` function.\n- **Toast Configuration**: The toast is configured with:\n  - `type`: The type of toast (e.g., ERROR).\n  - `title`: The title of the toast.\n  - `description`: A brief description of the notification.\n\n#### Advanced Options\n\nYou can pass additional options to customize the toast further:\n\n```tsx\n<Button\n  onClick={() =>\n    openToast({\n      type: 'SUCCESS', // SUCCESS | INFO | ERROR\n      title: 'Toast Title',\n      description: 'This is a great toast description.',\n      icon: 'ph-bold ph-pizza', // Specify an icon from Phosphor Icons\n      duration: 20000, // Duration in milliseconds (use Infinity to disable auto close)\n    })\n  }\n>\n  Open a Toast\n</Button>\n```\n\n- **`icon`**: Allows specifying an icon from a library (Phosphor Icons).\n- **`duration`**: Sets how long the toast should be displayed. A value of `20000` indicates it will last for 20 seconds. Setting it to `Infinity` prevents it from automatically closing.\n\n#### Deduplication\n\nTo prevent multiple instances of the same toast from being shown at once, you can use a unique `id`:\n\n```tsx\n<Button\n  onClick={() =>\n    openToast({\n      id: 'my-unique-toast',\n      title: 'Toast Title',\n      description: 'This is a great toast description.',\n    })\n  }\n>\n  Deduplicated Toast\n</Button>\n```\n\n- **`id`**: If a toast with the provided `id` is already open, it will not create a new instance when the button is clicked again.\n\n### Custom Toast Rendering\n\nFor more customization, you can create your custom toast component:\n\n```tsx\nimport * as Toast from '@/components/lib/Toast';\n\n<Toast.Provider duration={5000}>\n  <Toast.Root open={isOpen} onOpenChange={setIsOpen}>\n    <Toast.Title>My Title</Toast.Title>\n    <Toast.Description>My Description</Toast.Description>\n    <Toast.CloseButton />\n  </Toast.Root>\n\n  <Toast.Viewport />\n</Toast.Provider>\n```\n\n- **`Toast.Provider`**: Wraps around the toast components, allowing you to set default properties like `duration`.\n- **`Toast.Root`**: Represents the actual toast. It takes `open` and `onOpenChange` props to control its visibility.\n- **`Toast.Title` and `Toast.Description`**: Define the content of the toast.\n- **`Toast.CloseButton`**: Provides a button for users to dismiss the toast manually.\n- **`Toast.Viewport`**: Defines where the toast will be rendered on the screen.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis code snippet provides a comprehensive guide on how to use and customize toast notifications in a NEAR-based application using Radix UI. By following these examples, developers can create user-friendly notifications that enhance the user experience in their applications."}]}

Let's break down the code step by step:\n\n### Trait Definition: `ResultTypeExt`\n\n```rust\npub trait ResultTypeExt: seal::ResultTypeExtSeal {\n    type Okay;   // Associated type representing the successful value type\n    type Error;  // Associated type representing the error type\n}\n```\n\n- **`pub trait ResultTypeExt`:** This line declares a public trait named `ResultTypeExt`. Traits in Rust are similar to interfaces in other programming languages; they define a set of methods or associated types that can be implemented by different types.\n- **`seal::ResultTypeExtSeal`:** This indicates that `ResultTypeExt` is a sealed trait, meaning it can only be implemented for specific types (in this case, for `Result<T, E>`). This pattern is useful for preventing external code from implementing the trait for types not intended by the library authors, thus ensuring better control over trait implementations.\n\n### Implementation of the Trait for `Result<T, E>`\n\n```rust\nimpl<T, E> ResultTypeExt for Result<T, E> {\n    type Okay = T;    // When Result<T, E> is used, Okay is T\n    type Error = E;   // When Result<T, E> is used, Error is E\n}\n```\n\n- **`impl<T, E> ResultTypeExt for Result<T, E>`:** This line implements the `ResultTypeExt` trait for the standard `Result` type, which is a generic type that can hold either a success value of type `T` or an error value of type `E`.\n- **`type Okay = T;`**: This associated type defines `Okay` to represent the type of the successful value stored in the `Result<T, E>`.\n- **`type Error = E;`**: Similarly, this associated type defines `Error` to represent the type of the error value stored in the `Result<T, E>`.\n\n### The Sealed Trait Pattern\n\n```rust\nmod seal {\n    pub trait ResultTypeExtSeal {}\n\n    impl<T, E> ResultTypeExtSeal for Result<T, E> {}\n}\n```\n\n- **`mod seal`:** This module defines the sealing mechanism for the `ResultTypeExt` trait.\n- **`pub trait ResultTypeExtSeal`:** This is the sealed trait that acts as a marker. Only types that implement this trait can implement `ResultTypeExt`.\n- **`impl<T, E> ResultTypeExtSeal for Result<T, E>`:** Here, the `seal` module implements the `ResultTypeExtSeal` for the `Result<T, E>` type. This means that only the `Result<T, E>` type can implement the `ResultTypeExt` trait, achieving the sealing effect.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe code snippet effectively extends the functionality of the standard `Result` type in Rust by defining a trait (`ResultTypeExt`) that allows associated types for the successful and error values. By using the sealed trait pattern, it ensures that this extension is only applicable to the `Result` type, preventing misuse and maintaining control over the trait's implementations.

Without decoding or decompressing this string, it's challenging to provide a direct explanation of its content or functionality.\n\nIn the context of the NEAR Protocol, files typically consist of JavaScript, TypeScript, or Rust code that implements various features such as smart contracts, wallet functionalities, or dApp interfaces. Here's how you can generally interpret such files:\n\n1. **File Location**: The path `packages/ethereum-wallets/src/lib/icon.ts` suggests that this file is part of a library dealing with Ethereum wallets. It might provide functionalities related to wallet interactions, such as connecting to Ethereum networks, handling transactions, or managing wallet icons.\n\n2. **Structure of TypeScript Files**: Generally, a `.ts` file in a TypeScript codebase would contain:\n   - Imports: Statements bringing in other modules or libraries.\n   - Type Definitions: Types and interfaces to enforce type safety.\n   - Functions/Classes: Implementations of specific functionalities related to wallet operations.\n   - Exports: Making certain functions or classes available for use in other parts of the application.\n\n3. **Icon Management**: Given that the file is named `icon.ts`, it might include logic to manage or render wallet icons. This could involve loading SVG or PNG images, setting up styles for icons, or managing how icons are displayed in UI components.\n\n4. **Code Example**: Here is a simple example of what a typical icon management file might look like in TypeScript:\n\n```typescript\n// Import necessary libraries\nimport React from 'react';\n\n// Define a functional component for Wallet Icon\nconst WalletIcon: React.FC<{ size?: number }> = ({ size = 24 }) => {\n    return (\n        <svg width={size} height={size} viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n            <path d=\"M12 2C6.48 2 2 6.48 2 12s4.48 10 10 10 10-4.48 10-10S17.52 2 12 2zm0 18c-4.41 0-8-3.59-8-8s3.59-8 8-8 8 3.59 8 8-3.59 8-8 8z\" />\n        </svg>\n    );\n};\n\n// Export the WalletIcon component\nexport default WalletIcon;\n```\n\n### Summary\nIf you need a detailed explanation of a specific code snippet, please ensure it’s presented in a readable code format.

Let's break down the two test functions provided: `test_storage_deposit_minimal_deposit` and `test_storage_deposit_refunds_excessive_deposit`.\n\n### `test_storage_deposit_minimal_deposit`\n\n```rust\nfn test_storage_deposit_minimal_deposit() -> anyhow::Result<()> {\n    // Set initial balance for the worker (sandbox environment)\n    let initial_balance = U128::from(NearToken::from_near(10000).as_yoctonear());\n    let worker = near_workspaces::sandbox().await?;\n    let (contract, _, _) = init(&worker, initial_balance).await?;\n\n    // Create a new subaccount with an initial balance of 10 NEAR\n    let new_account = contract\n        .as_account()\n        .create_subaccount(\"new-account\")\n        .initial_balance(NearToken::from_near(10))\n        .transact()\n        .await?\n        .into_result()?;\n\n    // Fetch the balance before storage deposit transaction\n    let new_account_balance_before_deposit = new_account.view_account().await?.balance;\n    let contract_balance_before_deposit = contract.view_account().await?.balance;\n\n    // Calculate the minimal deposit required for storage\n    let minimal_deposit = near_sdk::env::storage_byte_cost().saturating_mul(125);\n    \n    // Call the storage deposit method on the contract\n    new_account\n        .call(contract.id(), \"storage_deposit\")\n        .args(b\"{}\".to_vec()) // empty JSON object is passed as args\n        .max_gas()\n        .deposit(minimal_deposit) // deposit the minimal required amount\n        .transact()\n        .await?\n        .into_result()?;\n\n    // Calculate the balance difference after deposit\n    let new_account_balance_diff = new_account_balance_before_deposit\n        .saturating_sub(new_account.view_account().await?.balance);\n    \n    // Assert that the new account balance decreased by more than the minimal deposit due to transaction fees\n    assert!(new_account_balance_diff > minimal_deposit);\n    assert!(\n        new_account_balance_diff < minimal_deposit.saturating_add(NearToken::from_millinear(1))\n    );\n\n    // Check the contract's balance after the deposit\n    let contract_balance_diff =\n        contract.view_account().await?.balance.saturating_sub(contract_balance_before_deposit);\n    \n    // Assert that the contract balance increased by more than the minimal deposit\n    assert!(contract_balance_diff > minimal_deposit);\n    // Assert with an upper limit for small variations in gas rewards\n    assert!(\n        contract_balance_diff\n            < minimal_deposit.saturating_add(NearToken::from_yoctonear(50_000_000_000_000_000_000))\n    );\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\n1. **Setup**: The test initializes a sandbox environment with a specified initial balance (10,000 NEAR). It then initializes the contract.\n2. **Account Creation**: A new account (subaccount) is created with an initial balance of 10 NEAR.\n3. **Balance Check**: The balances of the new account and the contract are recorded before the storage deposit action.\n4. **Minimal Deposit Calculation**: The minimal deposit required for storage is calculated based on the NEAR protocol's storage costs.\n5. **Storage Deposit Call**: The new account calls the `storage_deposit` function on the contract, depositing the calculated minimal amount.\n6. **Balance Assertions**:\n   - The test checks that the balance of the new account has decreased by more than the minimal deposit (accounting for transaction fees).\n   - It also checks that the contract's balance increased by more than the minimal deposit due to receiving the deposit.\n\n### `test_storage_deposit_refunds_excessive_deposit`\n\n```rust\n#[tokio::test]\nasync fn test_storage_deposit_refunds_excessive_deposit() -> anyhow::Result<()> {\n    let initial_balance = U128::from(NearToken::from_near(10000).as_yoctonear());\n    let worker = near_workspaces::sandbox().await?;\n    let (contract, _, _) = init(&worker, initial_balance).await?;\n\n    // Calculate the minimal deposit required for storage\n    let minimal_deposit = near_sdk::env::storage_byte_cost().saturating_mul(125);\n\n    // Check storage balance bounds to ensure minimal deposit correctness\n    #[derive(near_sdk::serde::Serialize, near_sdk::serde::Deserialize)]\n    #[serde(crate = \"near_sdk::serde\")]\n    struct StorageBalanceBounds {\n        min: U128,\n        max: U128,\n    }\n    let storage_balance_bounds: StorageBalanceBounds =\n        contract.call(\"storage_balance_bounds\").view().await?.json()?;\n    \n    // Validate that the min and max storage bounds match the expected minimal deposit\n    assert_eq!(storage_balance_bounds.min, minimal_deposit.as_yoctonear().into());\n    assert_eq!(storage_balance_bounds.max, minimal_deposit.as_yoctonear().into());\n\n    // Check that a non-registered account does not have a storage balance\n    #[derive(near_sdk::serde::Serialize, near_sdk::serde::Deserialize)]\n    #[serde(crate = \"near_sdk::serde\")]\n    struct StorageBalanceOf {\n        total: U128,\n        available: U128,\n    }\n    let storage_balance_bounds: Option<StorageBalanceOf> = contract\n        .call(\"storage_balance_of\")\n        .args_json(near_sdk::serde_json::json!({\"account_id\": \"non-registered-account\"}))\n        .view()\n        .await?\n        .json()?;\n    assert!(storage_balance_bounds.is_none());\n\n    // Create a new account and deposit NEAR to cover storage\n    let new_account = contract\n        .as_account()\n        .create_subaccount(\"new-account\")\n        .initial_balance(NearToken::from_near(10))\n        .transact()\n        .await?\n        .into_result()?;\n\n    let new_account_balance_before_deposit = new_account.view_account().await?.balance;\n    let contract_balance_before_deposit = contract.view_account().await?.balance;\n\n    // Deposit more NEAR than the minimal required to test refund\n    new_account\n        .call(contract.id(), \"storage_deposit\")\n        .args(b\"{}\".to_vec())\n        .max_gas()\n        .deposit(NearToken::from_near(5)) // deposit 5 NEAR\n        .transact()\n        .await?\n        .into_result()?;\n\n    // The expected storage balance should be the minimal deposit,\n    // and the contract should gain the deposit.\n    let storage_balance_bounds: StorageBalanceOf = contract\n        .call(\"storage_balance_of\")\n        .args_json(near_sdk::serde_json::json!({\"account_id\": new_account.id()}))\n        .view()\n        .await?\n        .json()?;\n\n    // Assert that the storage balance reflects the minimal deposit\n    assert_eq!(storage_balance_bounds.total, minimal_deposit);\n    assert_eq!(storage_balance_bounds.available, minimal_deposit);\n    \n    // Assert that the new account balance decreased by the amount deposited\n    let new_account_balance_after_deposit = new_account.view_account().await?.balance;\n    let new_account_balance_diff = new_account_balance_before_deposit.saturating_sub(new_account_balance_after_deposit);\n    assert!(new_account_balance_diff >= NearToken::from_near(5));\n\n    // Assert that the contract's balance increased by the deposit amount\n    let contract_balance_after_deposit = contract.view_account().await?.balance;\n    let contract_balance_diff = contract_balance_after_deposit.saturating_sub(contract_balance_before_deposit);\n    assert!(contract_balance_diff >= NearToken::from_near(5));\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\n1. **Setup**: Similar to the first test, this initializes a sandbox and the contract.\n2. **Minimal Deposit Calculation**: The minimal deposit is calculated as before.\n3. **Storage Balance Bounds Check**: The test verifies that the contract's storage balance bounds for minimum and maximum deposits match the calculated minimal deposit.\n4. **Non-Registered Account Check**: It checks that a non-registered account does not have a storage balance.\n5. **Account Creation**: A new subaccount is created, and a deposit is made into it.\n6. **Excessive Deposit Test**: The new account calls the `storage_deposit` function to deposit 5 NEAR, which is more than the minimal deposit.\n7. **Assertions**:\n   - It checks that the storage balance reflects the minimal deposit.\n   - It verifies the new account's balance has decreased appropriately due to the deposit.\n   - It ensures that the contract’s balance has increased by the amount deposited.\n\n### Summary\nThese two test functions are designed to ensure the proper functioning of storage deposits in the NEAR Protocol's fungible token contract.

In this context, it appears to be related to testing the validity of account IDs and the functionality of various cryptographic hash functions, as well as the `ecrecover` functionality, which is often used in smart contracts for signature recovery.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the key components of the code provided:\n\n### Invalid Account ID Test\n\n```rust\nfor account_id in [\n    \"-near\",\n    \"near-\",\n    \"-near-\",\n    \"near.\",\n    \".near\",\n    \"near@\",\n    \"@near\",\n    \"неар\",\n    \"@@@@@\",\n    \"0__0\",\n    \"0_-_0\",\n    \"0_-_0\",\n    \"..\",\n    \"a..near\",\n    \"nEar\",\n    \"_bowen\",\n    \"hello world\",\n    \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\",\n    \"01234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234\",\n    // `@` separators are banned now\n    \"some-complex-address@gmail.com\",\n    \"sub.buy_d1gitz@atata@b0-rg.c_0_m\",\n] {\n    assert!(\n        !is_valid_account_id(account_id.as_ref()),\n        \"Invalid account id {:?} marked valid\",\n        account_id\n    );\n}\n```\n\n1. **Purpose**: This loop tests a collection of strings to ensure that they are recognized as invalid account IDs using the `is_valid_account_id` function. Each test case is an invalid format that should fail the validation check.\n\n2. **Account ID Examples**: The provided account IDs include various invalid formats:\n   - Leading/trailing special characters (like `-` or `.`)\n   - Multi-part IDs with invalid separators (like `@` or a space)\n   - Extremely long strings that exceed typical length limits.\n\n3. **Assertion**: The `assert!` macro is used to check that the `is_valid_account_id` function returns `false` for each invalid account ID. If an invalid account ID is mistakenly marked as valid, the test will fail, and it will print which account ID caused the failure.\n\n### Binary Validity Tests\n\n```rust\n#[test]\nfn test_is_valid_account_id_binary() {\n    assert!(!is_valid_account_id(&[]));\n    assert!(!is_valid_account_id(&[0]));\n    assert!(!is_valid_account_id(&[0, 1]));\n    assert!(!is_valid_account_id(&[0, 1, 2]));\n    assert!(is_valid_account_id(b\"near\"));\n}\n```\n\n- This function tests `is_valid_account_id` using byte arrays. It checks that empty arrays and arrays with invalid content are marked as invalid, while a valid byte array corresponding to the string `\"near\"` is recognized as valid.\n\n### Hashing Function Tests\n\n```rust\n#[cfg(not(target_arch = \"wasm32\"))]\n#[test]\nfn hash_smoke_tests() {\n    assert_eq!(\n        &super::sha256_array(b\"some value\"),\n        hex::decode(\"ab3d07f3169ccbd0ed6c4b45de21519f9f938c72d24124998aab949ce83bb51b\")\n            .unwrap()\n            .as_slice()\n    );\n    // Additional tests for keccak256, keccak512, and ripemd160...\n}\n```\n\n- This section tests various hashing functions (SHA-256, Keccak-256, etc.) to ensure they produce the expected output for a given input (`b\"some value\"`).\n\n### Random Seed Tests\n\n```rust\n#[cfg(not(target_arch = \"wasm32\"))]\n#[test]\nfn random_seed_smoke_test() {\n    crate::testing_env!(crate::test_utils::VMContextBuilder::new()\n        .random_seed([8; 32])\n        .build());\n\n    assert_eq!(super::random_seed(), [8; 32]);\n}\n```\n\n- This test sets up a testing environment and verifies that the `random_seed` function returns the expected byte array. This is useful for ensuring that the randomness in the system is functioning correctly.\n\n### Ecrecover Functionality Testing\n\n```rust\n#[cfg(not(target_arch = \"wasm32\"))]\n#[cfg(feature = \"unstable\")]\n#[test]\nfn test_ecrecover() {\n    // Deserialize EcrecoverTest structures and run tests...\n}\n```\n\n- This portion outlines a test for the `ecrecover` functionality, which is vital for verifying signatures in smart contracts. The structure `EcrecoverTest` is defined to facilitate testing various inputs and expected outputs.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis code snippet serves as a comprehensive test suite for validating account IDs, cryptographic functions, random seed generation, and signature recovery. Each test ensures that the NEAR Protocol's functionalities work as intended, maintaining the integrity and security of the blockchain platform."}]}

It defines some functionalities for working with the alt-BN128 cryptographic operations and also provides a test suite to verify the correctness of the mocked blockchain API. Let's break down the components of this snippet for clarity.\n\n### Functions for Alt-BN128 Operations\nAt the top of the snippet, there are two functions that interface with the alt-BN128 cryptographic operations:\n\n```rust\n#[no_mangle]\nextern \"C-unwind\" fn alt_bn128_g1_sum(value_len: u64, value_ptr: u64, register_id: u64) {\n    with_mock_interface(|b| b.alt_bn128_g1_sum(value_len, value_ptr, register_id))\n}\n\n#[no_mangle]\nextern \"C-unwind\" fn alt_bn128_pairing_check(value_len: u64, value_ptr: u64) -> u64 {\n    with_mock_interface(|b| b.alt_bn128_pairing_check(value_len, value_ptr))\n}\n```\n\n- **`#[no_mangle]`**: This attribute indicates that the Rust compiler should not mangle the names of these functions. This is often used when the functions are meant to be called from other languages (like C).\n- **`extern \"C-unwind\"`**: This specifies the calling convention, allowing these functions to be called in a way compatible with C (with the \"unwind\" part referring to how the stack is managed).\n- **`with_mock_interface`**: This is likely a macro or function that provides a mock implementation to test the blockchain's behavior without needing to interact with the actual network. It passes a closure to execute the desired operation on the mock interface.\n\n### Test Module\nThe test module is structured using Rust's built-in test framework. Here's a breakdown of the test case:\n\n```rust\n#[cfg(test)]\nmod tests {\n    use std::str::FromStr;\n    use near_gas::NearGas;\n    use near_primitives::types::GasWeight;\n\n    use crate::{\n        env,\n        test_utils::{accounts, get_created_receipts, get_logs},\n        testing_env,\n    };\n\n    use super::*;\n\n    #[test]\n    fn test_mocked_blockchain_api() {\n        let public_key: crate::types::PublicKey =\n            \"ed25519:H3C2AVAWKq5Qm7FkyDB5cHKcYKHgbiiB2BzX8DQX8CJ\".parse().unwrap();\n        let context = VMContextBuilder::new()\n            .signer_account_id(accounts(0))\n            .signer_account_pk(public_key.clone())\n            .build();\n\n        testing_env!(context.clone());\n```\n\n- **`#[cfg(test)]`**: This attribute indicates that the following module should only be compiled and included when running tests.\n- **Imports**: The module imports various types and utilities needed for testing, including gas-related types and functions to interact with the mock environment.\n- **`test_mocked_blockchain_api`**: This function contains the actual test logic.\n\n#### Key Assertions in the Test\nInside the `test_mocked_blockchain_api` function, various assertions are made to verify the behavior of the mocked blockchain:\n\n1. **Context Setup**:\n   - A public key is defined and parsed.\n   - A `VMContext` is created to simulate the environment in which the smart contract would run.\n\n2. **Assertions**:\n   - It checks that the signer account ID and public key match the expected values.\n   - It tests the storage operations: writing, reading, checking existence, and removing a key.\n   - It tests promise creation and actions such as function calls and staking with the promise.\n\n3. **Logging**:\n   - It logs a string and verifies that the log was correctly captured.\n\n4. **Actions**:\n   - It checks the created receipts and the actions associated with them, ensuring that the mocked actions behave as expected.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis snippet is a crucial part of the NEAR Protocol's testing framework, allowing developers to simulate blockchain behavior without needing to deploy to a live environment. By using this mock setup, developers can ensure their smart contracts and blockchain interactions behave correctly before deploying to the actual NEAR network.

This is a common way to embed image data directly in HTML or CSS without needing an external image file.\n\n2. **Image Data**:\n   - The long string that follows is the Base64 encoded representation of a PNG image. Base64 encoding is a method of converting binary data (like an image) into a text string using a specific set of 64 characters. This is useful for embedding images directly into web pages or applications.\n\n3. **JavaScript Export**:\n   - The `export default` statement allows this encoded image to be imported and used in other JavaScript or TypeScript files. This is a standard ES6 module export syntax, enabling modular development.\n\n### Use Case\nThis encoded image can be used in a variety of contexts within a NEAR application, such as:\n- Displaying an icon or logo within a user interface.\n- Using it as a part of a web component that needs to render the image.\n- Including it in stylesheets for background images or other decorative uses.\n\n### Example of Usage\nHere’s how you might use this exported image in a React component:\n\n```javascript\nimport React from 'react';\nimport iconImage from './path/to/icon'; // Adjust the path as necessary\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n    return (\n        <div>\n            <img src={iconImage} alt=\"My Icon\" />\n        </div>\n    );\n};\n\nexport default MyComponent;\n```\n\nIn this example, the `iconImage` variable will hold the Base64 encoded image data, allowing it to be rendered as an image in the React component."}]}

Let's break down the key components and functionalities of this code:\n\n### Imports\n\n```rust\nuse color_eyre::eyre::ContextCompat;\nuse strum::{EnumDiscriminants, EnumIter, EnumMessage};\n```\n- **color_eyre**: A library for error handling that provides context for errors, making debugging easier.\n- **strum**: A crate that provides macros and traits for working with enums, such as deriving methods for enumerating variants and assigning messages.\n\n### Module Declarations\n\n```rust\nmod add_connection;\nmod delete_connection;\nmod edit_connection;\n```\nThese lines declare three submodules for handling different configuration actions related to network connections: adding, deleting, and editing connections.\n\n### ConfigCommands Struct\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Debug, Clone, interactive_clap::InteractiveClap)]\n#[interactive_clap(context = crate::GlobalContext)]\npub struct ConfigCommands {\n    #[interactive_clap(subcommand)]\n    config_actions: ConfigActions,\n}\n```\n- **ConfigCommands**: A struct that represents the main command for configuration actions in the CLI. It uses the `InteractiveClap` derive macro to integrate with the `clap` library, which is used for building command-line interfaces.\n- **config_actions**: This field holds the different subcommands available for configuration, specified by the `ConfigActions` enum.\n\n### ConfigActions Enum\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Debug, EnumDiscriminants, Clone, interactive_clap::InteractiveClap)]\n#[interactive_clap(context = crate::GlobalContext)]\n#[strum_discriminants(derive(EnumMessage, EnumIter))]\n#[non_exhaustive]\npub enum ConfigActions {\n    #[strum_discriminants(strum(message = \"show-connections       - Show a list of network connections\"))]\n    ShowConnections(ShowConnections),\n    #[strum_discriminants(strum(message = \"add-connection         - Add a network connection\"))]\n    AddConnection(self::add_connection::AddNetworkConnection),\n    #[strum_discriminants(strum(message = \"edit-connection        - Edit a network connection\"))]\n    EditConnection(self::edit_connection::EditConnection),\n    #[strum_discriminants(strum(message = \"delete-connection      - Delete a network connection\"))]\n    DeleteConnection(self::delete_connection::DeleteNetworkConnection),\n}\n```\n- **ConfigActions**: An enum that defines various actions that can be taken regarding the CLI configuration.\n- The `EnumDiscriminants`, `EnumMessage`, and `EnumIter` traits from the `strum` crate provide additional functionality, such as generating messages associated with each variant and allowing iteration over the enum variants.\n- Each variant of the enum corresponds to a specific action (showing, adding, editing, or deleting connections) and references the respective submodules for their implementations.\n\n### ShowConnections Struct\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Debug, Clone, interactive_clap::InteractiveClap)]\n#[interactive_clap(input_context = crate::GlobalContext)]\n#[interactive_clap(output_context = ShowConnectionsContext)]\npub struct ShowConnections;\n```\n- **ShowConnections**: Represents the command to show network connections. Like `ConfigCommands`, it also uses the `InteractiveClap` derive macro, enabling it to participate in the CLI context.\n\n### ShowConnectionsContext Struct\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Debug, Clone)]\npub struct ShowConnectionsContext;\n```\n- A simple struct that will hold context information related to showing connections.\n\n### Implementation of ShowConnectionsContext\n\n```rust\nimpl ShowConnectionsContext {\n    pub fn from_previous_context(\n        previous_context: crate::GlobalContext,\n        _scope: &<ShowConnections as interactive_clap::ToInteractiveClapContextScope>::InteractiveClapContextScope,\n    ) -> color_eyre::eyre::Result<Self> {\n        let mut path_config_toml =\n            dirs::config_dir().wrap_err(\"Impossible to get your config dir!\")?;\n        path_config_toml.push(\"near-cli/config.toml\");\n        eprintln!(\n            \"\\nConfiguration data is stored in a file {:?}\",\n            &path_config_toml\n        );\n        let config_toml = toml::to_string(&previous_context.config)?;\n        eprintln!(\"{}\", &config_toml);\n        Ok(Self)\n    }\n}\n```\n- **from_previous_context**: A method that constructs a `ShowConnectionsContext` from a previous context (`GlobalContext`).\n    - It attempts to find the configuration directory and constructs the path to the `config.toml` file.\n    - It uses `color_eyre` for error handling, providing context if there’s an issue retrieving the configuration directory.\n    - The method prints the location of the configuration file and the contents of the configuration in TOML format.\n    - Returns an instance of `ShowConnectionsContext` upon success.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis code snippet is structured to define a command-line interface for managing network connections in the NEAR CLI. It leverages Rust's strong type system, the `strum` crate for enum handling, and the `interactive_clap` library for interactive command-line input. Each subcommand is modularized for clarity and separation of logic, facilitating maintainability and extensibility of the codebase."}]}

If the build fails with processes being killed, you\nmight want to try reducing number of parallel jobs, for example:\n`CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=8 make neard`.\n\nNB. Please ensure you build releases through `make` rather than `cargo\nbuild --release`.  The latter skips some optimisations (most notably\nlink-time optimisation) and thus produces a less efficient executable.\n\nIf your machine is behind a firewall or NAT, make sure port 24567 is\nopen and forwarded to the machine where the node is going to be\nrunning.\n\nFinally, execute:\n\n```bash\nnearup run testnet --binary-path path/to/nearcore/target/release\n```\n\nIf you want to run `localnet` instead of `testnet`, then replace\n`testnet` with `localnet` in the command above.

Below is a detailed breakdown of the content, highlighting key points and instructions for developers:\n\n### Summary of the Code Snippet\n\n1. **Objective**:\n   - The document guides users on how to compile the `neard` binary locally and run a NEAR node using `nearup`, a tool for managing NEAR node installations.\n\n2. **Prerequisites**:\n   - **Rust Installation**: Before proceeding, users must ensure that Rust is installed on their machine. The document provides a link to the installation instructions.\n   - **Platform-Specific Requirements**:\n     - **macOS**: Users need to install developer tools and additional dependencies via Homebrew:\n       ```bash\n       brew install cmake protobuf clang llvm\n       ```\n     - **Linux**: Users should install various dependencies using the package manager:\n       ```bash\n       sudo apt update\n       sudo apt install -y git binutils-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev zlib1g-dev libdw-dev libiberty-dev cmake gcc g++ python docker.io protobuf-compiler libssl-dev pkg-config clang llvm\n       ```\n\n3. **Cloning the Repository**:\n   - Users are instructed to clone the NEAR core repository from GitHub:\n     ```bash\n     git clone https://github.com/near/nearcore.git\n     cd nearcore\n     ```\n\n4. **Version Checkout**:\n   - After cloning, users can check out the specific version of the NEAR core they wish to build:\n     ```bash\n     git checkout <version>\n     ```\n\n5. **Building the `neard` Binary**:\n   - The compilation command is provided:\n     ```bash\n     make neard\n     ```\n   - It is important to note that the compiled binary will be located at `target/release/neard`.\n\n6. **Memory Considerations**:\n   - Compilation requires significant memory (over 1 GB per virtual core). If the process is killed due to insufficient memory, users are advised to reduce the number of parallel jobs:\n     ```bash\n     CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=8 make neard\n     ```\n\n7. **Build Optimization**:\n   - The document emphasizes the importance of using `make` for building the release instead of `cargo build --release`, as the latter skips certain optimizations.\n\n8. **Firewall Considerations**:\n   - Users running the node behind a firewall or NAT should ensure that port 24567 is open and forwarded.\n\n9. **Running the Node**:\n   - The command to run the node is provided, allowing users to choose between `testnet` and `localnet`:\n     ```bash\n     nearup run testnet --binary-path path/to/nearcore/target/release\n     ```\n   - Users will be prompted for a validator ID, which they can skip if they do not wish to validate.\n\n10. **Cloud Deployment**:\n    - For running a node on the cloud, users are instructed to create an instance with appropriate hardware, set firewall rules, and SSH into the machine to follow the previously mentioned steps.\n\n11. **Success Messages**:\n    - After executing the commands, users can expect to see success messages that confirm the node is running and provide further instructions for checking logs.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis documentation snippet serves as a comprehensive guide for developers looking to run a NEAR node locally without Docker. It provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the environment, building the necessary binaries, and running the node, along with considerations for system resources and network configurations. This structured approach ensures that even those new to NEAR Protocol can successfully set up their node."}]}

Below is a breakdown of the key components of the snippet, along with explanations for each section.\n\n### Overview\n\nThe snippet starts with a Markdown header that indicates the purpose of the documentation:\n\n```markdown\n---\nid: contracts\ntitle: Accounts / Contracts\n---\n```\n\nThis metadata section is used by the documentation system to identify the page and provide a title.\n\n### Importing Components\n\n```javascript\nimport Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';\nimport TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';\n```\n\nThese lines import components for creating tabbed content in the documentation. This allows for displaying multiple examples in a compact format, making it easier for developers to see different ways to interact with the API.\n\n### API Description\n\n```markdown\nThe RPC API enables you to view details about accounts and contracts as well as perform contract calls.\n```\n\nThis sentence provides a brief overview of what the RPC API can do, emphasizing its capabilities to retrieve account information and execute contract functions.\n\n### View Account Section\n\n#### Method Description\n\n```markdown\n## View account {#view-account}\n\n> Returns basic account information.\n```\n\nThis section introduces the specific functionality to view account details, highlighting its purpose.\n\n#### Method Parameters\n\n```markdown\n- method: `query`\n- params:\n  - `request_type`: `view_account`\n  - [`finality`](/api/rpc/setup#using-finality-param) _OR_ [`block_id`](/api/rpc/setup#using-block_id-param)\n  - `account_id`: _`\"example.testnet\"`_\n```\n\nHere, the documentation specifies the method (`query`) and the required parameters for the request. The `request_type` indicates that the request is for viewing account information. The `finality` parameter can be used to specify the desired finality of the data returned, and `account_id` is the identifier for the account being queried.\n\n### Example Requests\n\nThe documentation provides three different formats for making the `view_account` request:\n\n1. **JSON Format**:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n     \"id\": \"dontcare\",\n     \"method\": \"query\",\n     \"params\": {\n       \"request_type\": \"view_account\",\n       \"finality\": \"final\",\n       \"account_id\": \"nearkat.testnet\"\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n   This is a raw JSON object that can be sent directly to the RPC endpoint.\n\n2. **JavaScript Example**:\n   ```javascript\n   const response = await near.connection.provider.query({\n     request_type: \"view_account\",\n     finality: \"final\",\n     account_id: \"nearkat.testnet\",\n   });\n   ```\n   This shows how to use the NEAR JavaScript SDK to perform the same query programmatically.\n\n3. **HTTPie Command**:\n   ```bash\n   http post https://rpc.testnet.near.org jsonrpc=2.0 id=dontcare method=query \\\n     params:='{\n       \"request_type\": \"view_account\",\n       \"finality\": \"final\",\n       \"account_id\": \"nearkat.testnet\"\n     }'\n   ```\n   This command-line example demonstrates how to use HTTPie to send the request to the NEAR RPC endpoint.\n\n### Example Response\n\nThe documentation provides an example of a successful response from the API:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"result\": {\n    \"amount\": \"399992611103597728750000000\",\n    \"locked\": \"0\",\n    \"code_hash\": \"11111111111111111111111111111111\",\n    \"storage_usage\": 642,\n    \"storage_paid_at\": 0,\n    \"block_height\": 17795474,\n    \"block_hash\": \"9MjpcnwW3TSdzGweNfPbkx8M74q1XzUcT1PAN8G5bNDz\"\n  },\n  \"id\": \"dontcare\"\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON response contains details about the account, such as its balance (`amount`), current storage usage, and metadata about the block in which the account state was last updated.\n\n### Error Handling\n\n#### Error Structure\n\nThe section describes how errors are structured in the RPC server response:\n```json\n{\n    \"error\": {\n        \"name\": <ERROR_TYPE>,\n        \"cause\": {\n            \"info\": {..},\n            \"name\": <ERROR_CAUSE>\n        },\n        \"code\": -32000,\n        \"data\": String,\n        \"message\": \"Server error\",\n    },\n    \"id\": \"dontcare\",\n    \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\"\n}\n```\nThis JSON structure provides information about the type of error that occurred, allowing developers to handle different error cases programmatically.\n\n#### Examples of Error Variants\n\nThe documentation includes a table listing potential error types and their causes, aiding developers in anticipating and managing possible issues when making API calls.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis documentation snippet effectively illustrates how to interact with the NEAR Protocol's RPC API to retrieve information about accounts. It provides structured examples in JSON, JavaScript, and HTTPie formats, along with detailed explanations of parameters and error handling, making it a comprehensive resource for developers working with NEAR."}]}

Below is a detailed explanation of the components and functionalities of the code:\n\n### Overview\n\nThe code is structured to test various functionalities of a wallet implementation using a mock setup. It utilizes `jest` for mocking dependencies and assertions. The key functionalities being tested include signing in and out, fetching accounts, and signing & sending transactions.\n\n### Key Components\n\n1. **Imports**:\n   ```typescript\n   import type { Near, WalletConnection, ConnectedWalletAccount } from \"near-api-js\";\n   import type { AccountView } from \"near-api-js/lib/providers/provider\";\n   import { mock } from \"jest-mock-extended\";\n   import { mockWallet } from \"../../../core/src/lib/testUtils\";\n   import type { MockWalletDependencies } from \"../../../core/src/lib/testUtils\";\n   import type { BrowserWallet } from \"../../../core/src/lib/wallet\";\n   ```\n   - This section imports necessary types and mocking utilities from `near-api-js`, a library used to interact with the NEAR blockchain.\n   - `mock` from `jest-mock-extended` is used to create mock instances of classes/interfaces.\n\n2. **Creating a Mock Wallet**:\n   ```typescript\n   const createArepaWallet = async (deps: MockWalletDependencies = {}) => {\n       // Create mocks for WalletConnection and ConnectedWalletAccount\n       const walletConnection = mock<WalletConnection>();\n       const account = mock<ConnectedWalletAccount>({\n           connection: {\n               signer: {\n                   getPublicKey: jest.fn().mockReturnValue(\"\"),\n               },\n           },\n       });\n       ...\n   };\n   ```\n   - The `createArepaWallet` function initializes mock instances of `WalletConnection` and `ConnectedWalletAccount`. This allows testing without needing to interact with the actual NEAR blockchain.\n\n3. **Mocking Functions**:\n   ```typescript\n   jest.mock(\"near-api-js\", () => {\n       const module = jest.requireActual(\"near-api-js\");\n       return {\n           ...module,\n           connect: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(mock<Near>()),\n           WalletConnection: jest.fn().mockReturnValue(walletConnection),\n       };\n   });\n   ```\n   - The `jest.mock` function replaces the actual `near-api-js` module's functions with mocked versions. This allows for controlled testing of how the wallet interacts with the API.\n\n4. **Mock Implementations**:\n   ```typescript\n   walletConnection.isSignedIn.calledWith().mockReturnValue(true);\n   walletConnection.getAccountId.calledWith().mockReturnValue(\"test-account.testnet\");\n   walletConnection.account.calledWith().mockReturnValue(account);\n   ...\n   ```\n   - Mock implementations are defined for various methods on the `walletConnection` and `account` to simulate their behavior during tests. This includes simulating a signed-in state and returning a mock account ID.\n\n5. **Tests**:\n   Each `describe` block contains tests for specific functionalities of the wallet:\n   - **Sign In**:\n     ```typescript\n     describe(\"signIn\", () => {\n         it(\"sign into near wallet\", async () => {\n             const { wallet, nearApiJs } = await createArepaWallet();\n             await wallet.signIn({ contractId: \"test.testnet\" });\n             expect(nearApiJs.connect).toHaveBeenCalled();\n         });\n     });\n     ```\n     - Tests if the `signIn` method correctly calls the `connect` function from `near-api-js`.\n\n   - **Sign Out**:\n     ```typescript\n     describe(\"signOut\", () => {\n         it(\"sign out of near wallet\", async () => {\n             const { wallet, walletConnection } = await createArepaWallet();\n             await wallet.signIn({ contractId: \"test.testnet\" });\n             await wallet.signOut();\n             expect(walletConnection.signOut).toHaveBeenCalled();\n         });\n     });\n     ```\n     - Tests if the `signOut` method calls the corresponding method on `walletConnection`.\n\n   - **Get Accounts**:\n     ```typescript\n     describe(\"getAccounts\", () => {\n         it(\"returns array of accounts\", async () => {\n             const { wallet, walletConnection } = await createArepaWallet();\n             await wallet.signIn({ contractId: \"test.testnet\" });\n             const result = await wallet.getAccounts();\n             expect(walletConnection.getAccountId).toHaveBeenCalled();\n             expect(result).toEqual([{ accountId: \"test-account.testnet\", publicKey: \"\" }]);\n         });\n     });\n     ```\n     - Tests the retrieval of account information.\n\n   - **Sign and Send Transaction**:\n     ```typescript\n     describe(\"signAndSendTransaction\", () => {\n         it(\"signs and sends transaction\", async () => {\n             const { wallet, walletConnection, account } = await createArepaWallet();\n             await wallet.signIn({ contractId: \"test.testnet\" });\n             const result = await wallet.signAndSendTransaction({\n                 receiverId: \"guest-book.testnet\",\n                 actions: [],\n             });\n             expect(walletConnection.account).toHaveBeenCalled();\n             expect(account.signAndSendTransaction).toHaveBeenCalled();\n             expect(account.signAndSendTransaction).toBeCalledWith({\n                 actions: [],\n                 receiverId: \"guest-book.testnet\",\n             });\n             expect(result).toEqual(null);\n         });\n     });\n     ```\n     - Tests if the `signAndSendTransaction` method correctly invokes the necessary methods and handles the transaction as expected.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis code snippet is an excellent example of unit testing within a blockchain context, specifically for a wallet implementation on NEAR Protocol. It demonstrates how to effectively mock dependencies and test various functionalities without requiring actual blockchain interactions. Each test case is designed to verify specific behavior, ensuring the wallet operates correctly within the NEAR ecosystem."}]}

If we're trying to hide the solution from the users, this isn't a great approach as it'll be public to anyone looking at the state. Let's instead hash our crossword solution and store that instead. There are different ways to hash data, but let's use `sha256` which is one of the hashing algorithms available in [the Rust SDK](https://docs.rs/near-sdk/latest/near_sdk/env/fn.sha256.html).\n\n:::info Remind me about hashing\nWithout getting into much detail, hashing is a \"one-way\" function that will output a result from a given input. If you have input (in our case, the crossword puzzle solution) you can get a hash, but if you have a hash you cannot get the input. This basic idea is foundational to information theory and security.\n\nLater on in this tutorial, we'll switch from using `sha256` to using cryptographic key pairs to illustrate additional NEAR concepts.\n\nLearn more about hashing from [Evgeny Kapun](https://github.com/abacabadabacaba)'s presentation on the subject. You may find other NEAR-related videos from the channel linked in the screenshot below.\n\n[![Evgeny Kapun presents details on hashing](/docs/assets/crosswords/kapun-hashing.png)](https://youtu.be/PfabikgnD08)\n:::\n\n## Helper unit test during rapid iteration\n\nAs mentioned in the first section of this **Basics** chapter, our smart contract is technically a library as defined in the manifest file. For our purposes, a consequence of writing a library in Rust is not having a \"main\" function that runs. You may find many online tutorials where the command `cargo run` is used during development. We don't have this luxury, but we can use unit tests to interact with our smart contract. This is likely more convenient than building the contract, deploying to a blockchain network, and calling a method.\n\nWe'll add a dependency to the [hex crate](https://crates.io/crates/hex) to make things easier. As you may remember, dependencies live in the manifest file.\n\n<Github language=\"rust\" start=\"10\" end=\"12\" url=\"https://github.com/near-examples/crossword-tutorial-chapter-1/blob/master/contract/Cargo.toml\" />\n\nLet's write a unit test that acts as a helper during development. This unit test will sha256 hash the input **\"near nomicon ref finance\"** and print it in a human-readable, hex format. (We'll typically put unit tests at the bottom of the `lib.rs` file.)\n\n<Github language=\"rust\" start=\"43\" end=\"60\" url=\"https://github.com/near-examples/crossword-tutorial-chapter-1/blob/master/contract/src/lib.rs\" />\n\n:::info What is that `{:?}` thing?\nTake a look at different formatting traits that are covered in the [`std` Rust docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/index.html#formatting-traits) regarding this. This is a `Debug` formatting trait and can prove to be useful during development.\n:::\n\nRun the unit tests with the command:\n\n```\ncargo test -- --nocapture\n```\n\nYou'll see this output:\n\n```\n…\nrunning 1 test\nLet's debug: \"69c2feb084439956193f4c21936025f14a5a5a78979d67ae34762e18a7206a0f\"\ntest tests::debug_get_hash ... ok\n\ntest result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s\n```\n\nThis means when you sha256 the input **\"near nomicon ref finance\"** it produces the hash:\n`69c2feb084439956193f4c21936025f14a5a5a78979d67ae34762e18a7206a0f`\n\n:::tip Note on the test flags\nYou may also run tests using:\n\n```\ncargo test\n```\n\nNote that the test command we ran had additional flags. Those flags told Rust```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This code snippet from the NEAR Protocol documentation provides an overview of hashing solutions and implementing unit tests in a smart contract using Rust. The section emphasizes the importance of securely storing sensitive data, such as crossword solutions, by hashing them instead of storing them as plain text.\n\nHere’s a detailed breakdown of the key components and concepts presented in the snippet:\n\n### Overview\n\n1. **Hashing the Solution**:\n   - The tutorial discusses the necessity of hashing the crossword solution to protect it from being exposed in plain text. Hashing transforms the solution into a fixed-size string of characters, which is not easily reversible. \n   - The chosen hashing algorithm for this example is `sha256`, which is commonly used for its security properties.\n\n2. **Hashing Concept**:\n   - Hashing is described as a \"one-way\" function, meaning that while you can calculate a hash from an input, you cannot derive the original input from the hash. This is a fundamental concept in cryptography and data security.\n\n3. **Unit Tests**:\n   - The code snippet emphasizes the use of unit tests for rapid iteration during development. Since Rust smart contracts do not have a conventional `main` function, unit tests serve as a convenient way to interact with the contract's code.\n   - The tutorial also suggests using a dependency from the `hex` crate to facilitate the conversion of binary hash outputs into human-readable hexadecimal format.\n\n4. **Example Unit Test**:\n   - The snippet outlines that a unit test will be created to hash a specific string (\"near nomicon ref finance\") and print the resulting hash in a readable format.\n   - The test output is shown, demonstrating the expected result of the hashing operation, which confirms the functionality.\n\n5. **Running Tests**:\n   - Instructions are provided on how to run the unit tests using the `cargo` command-line tool, including flags that allow visibility into test output.\n\n### Code Snippet Breakdown\n\nHere’s a brief explanation of important sections in the code snippets referenced in the documentation:\n\n- **Cargo.toml**:\n  This file is essential for managing dependencies in a Rust project. The documentation suggests adding the `hex` crate to facilitate hex conversion.\n\n- **lib.rs (Unit Test Example)**:\n  A unit test is defined typically at the bottom of this file, where you would see the implementation of the hash function and the test case that verifies the output.\n\n### Example Unit Test Code (Pseudocode)\n\nHere’s a conceptual example of what the unit test might look like in Rust:\n\n```rust\n#[cfg(test)]\nmod tests {\n    use super::*; // Import everything from the parent module\n    use near_sdk::env;\n    use near_sdk::assert_eq;\n\n    #[test]\n    fn test_hash_solution() {\n        // Input string to hash\n        let input = \"near nomicon ref finance\";\n        \n        // Calculate the sha256 hash of the input\n        let hash = env::sha256(input.as_bytes());\n        \n        // Convert the hash to hexadecimal format\n        let hex_hash = hex::encode(hash);\n        \n        // Print the hash for debugging purposes\n        println!(\"Hash of '{}': {}\", input, hex_hash);\n        \n        // Assert the expected hash (the expected hash value must be known)\n        assert_eq!(hex_hash, \"69c2feb084439956193f4c21936025f14a5a5a78979d67ae34762e18a7206a0f\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis section of the NEAR Protocol documentation effectively guides readers through the process of using hashing for security and implementing unit tests for smart contracts. By understanding these concepts, developers can ensure that sensitive data is protected and that their contracts are functioning as expected during development."}]}

Let's break it down:\n\n```typescript\nexport { KeyStore } from '@near-js/keystores';\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Export Statement**: The `export` keyword is used to export components, functions, classes, or variables from a module so that they can be imported and used in other modules. This makes the code modular and reusable.\n\n2. **KeyStore**: This refers to an entity (likely a class or a function) named `KeyStore` that is defined in another module. In the context of NEAR, a `KeyStore` typically handles the storage and retrieval of cryptographic keys. This is crucial for managing user accounts and signing transactions securely.\n\n3. **Module Import**: The `from '@near-js/keystores'` part indicates that `KeyStore` is being imported from the `@near-js/keystores` package. This package is part of the NEAR JavaScript SDK (Software Development Kit), which provides developers the necessary tools to build applications interacting with the NEAR Protocol.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, this line of code is exporting the `KeyStore` class or function from the `@near-js/keystores` module, making it available for use in other parts of the NEAR API JS library. This is a common pattern in JavaScript/TypeScript to facilitate the use of various components across different files, promoting better organization of code and modularity.\n\n### Usage\n\nWhen a developer wants to use the `KeyStore` functionality in their application, they would import it like so:\n\n```typescript\nimport { KeyStore } from 'path/to/keystore';\n// Now KeyStore can be used to manage keys\n```\n\nThis allows developers to leverage the key management features provided by the NEAR SDK without needing to understand the underlying implementation details."}]}

This encoding is often used for images or other files that need to be embedded directly in text files.\n\n2. **Purpose in the Code**:\n   - In the context of a TypeScript file (especially one related to wallets), this string could represent an icon, image, or some other asset that is used to visually represent a wallet or a feature in a user interface.\n\n### Decoding the String\n\nTo decode the Base64 string in JavaScript or TypeScript, you can use the following method:\n\n```typescript\n// Import required modules\nimport { Buffer } from 'buffer';\n\n// Base64-encoded string\nconst base64String = \"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\";\n\n// Decode the Base64 string\nconst decodedData = Buffer.from(base64String, 'base64');\n\n// You can now use `decodedData` as needed\nconsole.log(decodedData);\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe code snippet is a Base64-encoded representation of some binary data, likely an icon or image used within the NEAR wallet. The decoding process allows developers to retrieve the original binary data for rendering or processing within their applications. If you need further assistance with how to utilize this data or integrate it into a NEAR application, feel free to ask!"}]}

Let's break down the different components of this snippet:\n\n### Explanation of the Snippet\n\n1. **Title: `# Status Message`**\n   - This line indicates the title of the section in the README. The `#` symbol denotes a top-level heading in Markdown, which is used for structuring the document.\n\n2. **Description: `Records the status messages of the accounts that call this contract.`**\n   - This line gives a brief overview of what the \"Status Message\" example does. It explains that the smart contract is designed to keep track of status messages associated with user accounts that interact with it. This is a common use case in decentralized applications (dApps) where user status or messages need to be stored and retrieved.\n\n3. **Testing Section: `## Testing`**\n   - The `##` symbol indicates a second-level heading in Markdown, which organizes the README by creating a subsection. Here, it introduces the section dedicated to testing the smart contract.\n\n4. **Testing Command: `To test run:`**\n   - This line is a prompt indicating that the following command is used to execute tests for this specific contract.\n\n5. **Command: ```bash cargo test --package status-message -- --nocapture ```**\n   - This block shows the actual command that developers can use to run tests for the \"Status Message\" smart contract. Let's break down the command:\n     - `cargo`: This is the Rust package manager and build system. It is used for managing Rust projects.\n     - `test`: This subcommand runs the tests defined in the package.\n     - `--package status-message`: This option specifies that the tests for the `status-message` package should be executed. If your workspace contains multiple Rust packages, this option allows you to target a specific one.\n     - `-- --nocapture`: This flag tells Cargo to not capture standard output (stdout) during the test execution. By default, Cargo captures output, which can make it difficult to see log messages or printed output during tests. Using `--nocapture` allows you to see all output in real-time, which is often useful for debugging.\n\n### Summary\n\nOverall, this snippet serves as a guide for developers looking to understand the purpose of the \"Status Message\" example and how to test it. The clear structure and concise explanations make it easy for users to quickly grasp the functionality and testing procedure associated with the smart contract. \n\nIf you have any further questions about this example or need additional details on its implementation, feel free to ask!"}]}

Below, I'll break down the key components of the code to clarify its purpose and functionality.\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n1. **Function Signatures**:\n   - The first function (not fully shown) appears to handle a read-only function call to a NEAR smart contract, while the second function (`blocking_call_view_access_key`) retrieves access key information for a specific public key associated with an account. \n\n2. **Function Arguments**:\n   ```rust\n   args: Vec<u8>,\n   block_reference: near_primitives::types::BlockReference,\n   ```\n   - `args`: A vector of bytes that represents the arguments to be passed to the smart contract function.\n   - `block_reference`: This is a reference to a specific block in the NEAR blockchain, which can be used to determine the state of the blockchain at the time of the call.\n\n3. **Logging with Tracing**:\n   ```rust\n   tracing::Span::current().pb_set_message(&format!(\n       \"a read-only function '{function_name}' of the <{account_id}> contract ...\"\n   ));\n   ```\n   - The use of the `tracing` crate allows for structured logging. This line sets a message for the current tracing span, indicating that a read-only function of a certain contract is being called.\n\n4. **Creating a JSON RPC Query Request**:\n   ```rust\n   let query_view_method_request = near_jsonrpc_client::methods::query::RpcQueryRequest {\n       block_reference,\n       request: near_primitives::views::QueryRequest::CallFunction {\n           account_id: account_id.clone(),\n           method_name: function_name.to_owned(),\n           args: near_primitives::types::FunctionArgs::from(args),\n       },\n   };\n   ```\n   - This part constructs a `RpcQueryRequest` which specifies the `block_reference` and the details of the function call (including the account ID, method name, and arguments).\n\n5. **Making the Blocking Call**:\n   ```rust\n   let query_view_method_response = self\n       .blocking_call(query_view_method_request)\n       .wrap_err(\"Read-only function execution failed\")?;\n   ```\n   - This line performs the actual call to the NEAR JSON RPC endpoint using a blocking function. It wraps any errors encountered during the call with a custom error message.\n\n6. **Inspecting the Response**:\n   ```rust\n   query_view_method_response.call_result()\n       .inspect(|call_result| {\n           // Logging response details\n       })\n       .inspect_err(|_| {\n           // Logging error details\n       })\n   ```\n   - After receiving the response, the code inspects the result. If successful, it logs details of the JSON RPC response, including block hash, height, logs, and result. If there was an error, it logs an internal error message.\n\n7. **Access Key Information Retrieval**:\n   ```rust\n   fn blocking_call_view_access_key(\n       &self,\n       account_id: &near_primitives::types::AccountId,\n       public_key: &near_crypto::PublicKey,\n       block_reference: near_primitives::types::BlockReference,\n   ) -> Result<near_jsonrpc_primitives::types::query::RpcQueryResponse, ...> {\n   ```\n   - This function is designed to retrieve information about a specific access key associated with a given account and public key. It similarly constructs a query request and makes a blocking call to the NEAR JSON RPC.\n\n### Summary\nOverall, the snippet demonstrates how to interact with NEAR smart contracts by calling read-only functions and retrieving access key information using JSON RPC. The use of structured logging with `tracing` provides valuable insights into the operations being performed, which is beneficial for debugging and monitoring purposes.

This allows other modules to import this image data easily without needing to destructure it.\n\n2. **Data URI**:\n   - The string starts with `data:image/png;base64,`, which indicates that this is a Data URI. A Data URI allows you to include small data files inline in documents, such as HTML or CSS.\n   - The `image/png` specifies that the data is a PNG image.\n\n3. **Base64 Encoding**:\n   - The portion following `base64,` is a long string of characters that represents the image data encoded in Base64 format. This encoding is used to convert binary data (like images) into a text representation that can be safely included in text-based formats.\n\n4. **Purpose**:\n   - This kind of data URI is often used in web applications to embed images directly in the HTML or CSS. It reduces the number of HTTP requests that the browser has to make, potentially speeding up page load times for small images.\n   - In the NEAR ecosystem, this could be used for displaying icons or other small graphical elements in a user interface without needing an external file.\n\n### Usage Example\n\nHere’s a simple example of how you might use this Data URI in an HTML document:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Icon Example</title>\n    <style>\n        .icon {\n            width: 50px; /* Set the desired width */\n            height: 50px; /* Set the desired height */\n            background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'));\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div class=\"icon\"></div>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Summary\n\n- The code snippet you provided is a default export of a Base64-encoded PNG image, which can be used directly in web applications to minimize HTTP requests for small icons or images. This approach is common in frontend development to streamline resources and improve loading times."}]}

`FT_CONTRACT_FILEPATH`: Path to the fungible token contract.\n  - `REF_FINANCE_ACCOUNT_ID`: The account ID of the Ref Finance contract on the NEAR mainnet.\n  - `BLOCK_HEIGHT`: A specific block height for referencing the contract state.\n\n### Function: `create_ref`\n\n```rust\nasync fn create_ref(owner: &Account, worker: &Worker<Sandbox>) -> anyhow::Result<Contract> {\n    let mainnet = near_workspaces::mainnet_archival().await?;\n    let ref_finance_id: AccountId = REF_FINANCE_ACCOUNT_ID.parse()?;\n    \n    let ref_finance = worker\n        .import_contract(&ref_finance_id, &mainnet)\n        .initial_balance(NearToken::from_near(1000))\n        .block_height(BLOCK_HEIGHT)\n        .transact()\n        .await?;\n    \n    owner\n        .call(ref_finance.id(), \"new\")\n        .args_json(json!({\n            \"owner_id\": ref_finance.id(),\n            \"exchange_fee\": 4,\n            \"referral_fee\": 1,\n        }))\n        .transact()\n        .await?\n        .into_result()?;\n    \n    owner\n        .call(ref_finance.id(), \"storage_deposit\")\n        .args_json(json!({}))\n        .deposit(NearToken::from_millinear(30))\n        .transact()\n        .await?\n        .into_result()?;\n    \n    Ok(ref_finance)\n}\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: This function initializes the Ref Finance contract in a sandbox environment.\n- **Steps Inside the Function**:\n  1. **Connect to Mainnet**: It fetches the mainnet archival data to access the current state of the Ref Finance contract.\n  2. **Import Contract**: It imports the Ref Finance contract, setting an initial balance of 1000 NEAR tokens and specifying a block height.\n  3. **Contract Initialization**: Calls the `new` method on the Ref Finance contract to set the owner and fee configurations.\n  4. **Storage Deposit**: Calls the `storage_deposit` method to ensure that the contract has enough storage allocated.\n  \n### Function: `create_wnear`\n\n```rust\nasync fn create_wnear(owner: &Account, worker: &Worker<Sandbox>) -> anyhow::Result<Contract> {\n    let mainnet = near_workspaces::mainnet_archival().await?;\n    let wnear_id: AccountId = \"wrap.near\".to_string().try_into()?;\n    let wnear = worker\n        .import_contract(&wnear_id, &mainnet)\n        .block_height(BLOCK_HEIGHT)\n        .transact()\n        .await?;\n    \n    owner\n        .call(wnear.id(), \"new\")\n        .transact()\n        .await?\n        .into_result()?;\n    \n    owner\n        .call(wnear.id(), \"storage_deposit\")\n        .args_json(json!({}))\n        .deposit(NearToken::from_millinear(8))\n        .transact()\n        .await?\n        .into_result()?;\n    \n    owner\n        .call(wnear.id(), \"near_deposit\")\n        .deposit(NearToken::from_near(200))\n        .transact()\n        .await?\n        .into_result()?;\n    \n    Ok(wnear)\n}\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: This function sets up the Wrapped NEAR (WNear) contract.\n- **Steps Inside the Function**:\n  1. **Import WNear Contract**: Similar to the previous function, it imports the WNear contract from the mainnet.\n  2. **Initialize Contract**: Calls the `new` method to initialize the WNear contract.\n  3. **Storage Deposit**: Allocates storage for the WNear contract.\n  4. **NEAR Deposit**: Calls the `near_deposit` method to deposit 200 NEAR tokens into the WNear contract.\n\n### Function: `create_pool_with_liquidity`\n\n```rust\nasync fn create_pool_with_liquidity(\n    owner: &Account,\n    ref_finance: &Contract,\n    tokens: HashMap<&AccountId, u128>,\n) -> anyhow::Result<u64> {\n    let (token_ids, token_amounts): (Vec<String>, Vec<String>) = tokens\n        .iter()\n        .map(|(id, amount)| (id.to_string(), amount.to_string()))\n        .unzip();\n\n    ref_finance\n        .call(\"extend_whitelisted_tokens\")\n        .args_json(json!({ \"tokens\": token_ids }))\n        .transact()\n        .await?\n        .into_result()?;\n\n    let pool_id: u64 = ref_finance\n        .call(\"add_simple_pool\")\n        .args_json(json!({\n            \"tokens\": token_ids,\n            \"fee\": 25\n        }))\n        .deposit\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: This function creates a liquidity pool in the Ref Finance contract.\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `owner`: The account that will create the pool.\n  - `ref_finance`: The Ref Finance contract instance.\n  - `tokens`: A hashmap containing token IDs and their respective amounts to be added to the liquidity pool.\n- **Steps Inside the Function**:\n  1. **Extract Token IDs and Amounts**: It unzips the hashmap into two vectors: one for token IDs and another for token amounts.\n  2. **Extend Whitelisted Tokens**: Calls the `extend_whitelisted_tokens` method to add the tokens to the whitelist.\n  3. **Create Pool**: Calls the `add_simple_pool` method to create the pool and return the `pool_id`. The pool is created with a specified fee.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis code snippet effectively demonstrates how to set up and interact with smart contracts on the NEAR Protocol, particularly focusing on a decentralized finance (DeFi) application. It involves importing contracts, initializing them with specific parameters, and setting up liquidity pools. Each function is structured to handle asynchronous operations and return results in a way that is compatible with the Rust programming model. The use of `anyhow::Result` allows for extensive error handling and propagation, which is a common practice in Rust applications."}]}

This makes error messages and logs easier to read.\n\n2. **`assertCredentials` Function**:\n   ```javascript\n   async function assertCredentials(accountId, networkId, keyStore, usingLedger) {\n       if (usingLedger) return;\n\n       const key = await keyStore.getKey(networkId, accountId);\n       if (key) return;\n\n       console.error(chalk`You are trying to use the account {bold.white ${accountId}}, but do not have the credentials locally (network: {bold.white ${networkId}})`);\n       process.exit(1);\n   }\n   ```\n   - **Parameters**:\n     - `accountId`: The account ID for which credentials are being checked.\n     - `networkId`: The network (e.g., testnet, mainnet) associated with the account.\n     - `keyStore`: An object responsible for managing key storage.\n     - `usingLedger`: A boolean indicating whether a Ledger hardware wallet is being used.\n\n   - **Function Logic**:\n     - If `usingLedger` is `true`, the function exits early since Ledger handles credentials differently and does not require local key storage.\n     - The function attempts to retrieve the stored key for the provided `accountId` and `networkId` from the `keyStore`.\n     - If the key is found, the function exits without doing anything further.\n     - If the key is not found, an error message is printed to the console indicating that local credentials are missing for the specified account, and the process is terminated with `process.exit(1)`.\n\n3. **`storeCredentials` Function**:\n   ```javascript\n   async function storeCredentials(accountId, networkId, keyStore, keyPair, force) {\n       const key = await keyStore.getKey(networkId, accountId);\n\n       if (key && !force) {\n           console.log(chalk`The account {bold.white ${accountId}} already has local credentials (network: {bold.white ${networkId}})`);\n           return;\n       }\n\n       console.log(chalk`Storing credentials for account: {bold.white ${accountId}} (network: {bold.white ${networkId}})`);\n       console.log(`Saving key to '~/.near-credentials/${networkId}/${accountId}.json'`);\n       await keyStore.setKey(networkId, accountId, keyPair);\n   }\n   ```\n   - **Parameters**:\n     - `accountId`: The account ID for which credentials are being stored.\n     - `networkId`: The network associated with the account.\n     - `keyStore`: An object responsible for managing key storage.\n     - `keyPair`: The key pair (public/private keys) to be stored.\n     - `force`: A boolean indicating whether to overwrite existing credentials.\n\n   - **Function Logic**:\n     - The function first attempts to retrieve any existing key for the specified account and network.\n     - If a key exists and `force` is `false`, the function logs a message indicating that the credentials already exist and exits without making any changes.\n     - If no key exists (or `force` is `true`), it logs a message indicating that it is storing credentials for the specified account.\n     - The function then provides a path to where the key will be saved and calls `keyStore.setKey` to save the provided `keyPair` to the appropriate location.\n\n4. **Exporting Functions**:\n   ```javascript\n   module.exports = { assertCredentials, storeCredentials };\n   ```\n   - Both functions are exported as part of the module so they can be used in other parts of the application.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis code is crucial for managing NEAR account credentials. The `assertCredentials` function ensures that the necessary credentials are available before proceeding with operations that require account access. The `storeCredentials` function handles the storage of account credentials, allowing for an optional overwrite of existing credentials. Together, these functions help maintain a secure and user-friendly experience when interacting with NEAR accounts and networks."}]}

The snippet contains both a JSON object that represents the metadata of an NFT and a series of commands to interact with the NEAR blockchain.\n\n### Breakdown of the Code Snippet\n\n1. **SVG Data**:\n   ```json\n   \",13.08-7.31l30.1-44.69a3.2,3.2,0,0,0-4.75-4.2L96.14,186a1.2,1.2,0,0,1-2-.91V104.61a1.2,1.2,0,0,1,2.12-.77l89.55,107.23a15.35,15.35,0,0,0,11.71,5.43h3.13A15.34,15.34,0,0,0,216,201.16V87.84A15.34,15.34,0,0,0,200.66,72.5h0A15.35,15.35,0,0,0,187.58,79.81Z'/%3E%3C/g%3E%3C/svg%3E\"\n   ```\n   This part is likely an encoded SVG image that represents the NFT's visual identity. The string is encoded in a way that can be parsed and displayed by web applications.\n\n2. **Metadata Fields**:\n   ```json\n   \"base_uri\": null,\n   \"reference\": null,\n   \"reference_hash\": null\n   ```\n   - `base_uri`: This field is usually used to define a base URL for the NFT's media files. Here it is set to `null`, indicating that there is no base URI provided.\n   - `reference`: This field may be used to link to additional information about the NFT. It is also set to `null`.\n   - `reference_hash`: This field may contain a hash of a reference file for the NFT, which is also set to `null`.\n\n### Minting an NFT\n\nThe tutorial explains how to mint an NFT by invoking the `nft_mint` function on the NEAR contract. \n\n#### Example Command to Mint an NFT\n\n```bash\nnear call $ID nft_mint '{\"token_id\": \"0\", \"receiver_id\": \"'$ID'\", \"token_metadata\": { \"title\": \"Some Art\", \"description\": \"My NFT media\", \"media\": \"https://bafkreiabag3ztnhe5pg7js4bj6sxuvkz3sdf76cjvcuqjoidvnfjz7vwrq.ipfs.dweb.link/\", \"copies\": 1}}' --accountId $ID --deposit 0.1\n```\n\n- **$ID**: This is a placeholder for the account ID of the user minting the NFT.\n- **nft_mint**: This is the function being called to create a new NFT.\n- **token_id**: A unique identifier for the token being minted (in this case, \"0\").\n- **receiver_id**: The account ID that will receive the minted NFT.\n- **token_metadata**: This is where you define the metadata for the NFT, including:\n  - `title`: The title of the NFT.\n  - `description`: A brief description of the NFT.\n  - `media`: The URL pointing to the NFT's media, which should be uploaded to IPFS.\n  - `copies`: The number of copies of this NFT.\n\n### Example Response After Minting\n\nOn successful minting, you would receive a response similar to:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"token_id\": \"0\",\n  \"owner_id\": \"dev-xxxxxx-xxxxxxx\",\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"title\": \"Some Art\",\n    \"description\": \"My NFT media\",\n    \"media\": \"https://bafkreabag3ztnhe5pg7js4bj6sxuvkz3sdf76cjvcuqjoidvnfjz7vwrq.ipfs.dweb.link/\",\n    \"media_hash\": null,\n    \"copies\": 1,\n    \"issued_at\": null,\n    \"expires_at\": null,\n    \"starts_at\": null,\n    \"updated_at\": null,\n    \"extra\": null,\n    \"reference\": null,\n    \"reference_hash\": null\n  },\n  \"approved_account_ids\": {}\n}\n```\n\n### Viewing Owned Tokens\n\nTo view the NFTs owned by a specific account, you can use:\n\n```bash\nnear view $ID nft_tokens_for_owner '{\"account_id\": \"'$ID'\"}'\n```\n\nThis command queries the NFT contract to return a list of tokens owned by the specified account.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis tutorial snippet provides a practical example of how to mint an NFT on the NEAR Protocol. It highlights the key components involved in the minting process, including the metadata structure and the commands used to interact with the NEAR blockchain. By following these steps, developers can easily create and manage NFTs within the NEAR ecosystem."}]}

It also attempts to calculate and display the USD equivalent of the transaction fee using the fetched exchange rate, handling potential errors gracefully.\n\n```rust\neprintln!(\"Transaction ID: {id}\\nTo see the transaction in the transaction explorer, please open this url in your browser:\\n{path}{id}\\n\",\n    id=transaction_info.transaction_outcome.id,\n    path=network_config.explorer_transaction_url\n);\n```\n- Finally, it prints the transaction ID along with a URL to view the transaction on a block explorer, making it easy for the user to track the transaction.\n\n### Summary\nThis code snippet effectively processes and summarizes the results of a NEAR transaction, providing a user-friendly output that includes logs, gas usage, transaction fees, and error handling. It illustrates good programming practices by managing different outcomes of a transaction, formatting the output for clarity, and ensuring that potential errors are captured and reported back to the user. The use of types such as `Option` and `Result` demonstrates Rust's emphasis on safety and error handling."}]}

Let's break down the code step by step to understand its functionality and purpose.\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n```javascript\nconst ammContract = \"v2.ref-finance.near\"; // Define the address of the AMM (Automated Market Maker) contract\nconst result = Near.view( // Call the `view` method on the NEAR object\n  ammContract, // The contract we are interacting with\n  \"get_pools\", // The method we want to call on the contract\n  { // The parameters we are passing to the method\n    from_index: 0, // Start fetching pools from index 0\n    limit: 1000 // Limit the number of results to 1000\n  }\n);\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **ammContract**: \n   - This is a constant that holds the address of the AMM contract on the NEAR blockchain. In this case, it points to `v2.ref-finance.near`, which is likely a DEX implementation.\n\n2. **Near.view()**: \n   - This function is part of the NEAR API and is used to call a \"view\" method on a smart contract. View methods do not alter the state of the blockchain and are free to call (you won't incur gas fees). \n\n3. **Parameters for Near.view()**:\n   - The first parameter is the contract address (`ammContract`).\n   - The second parameter is the name of the method to call on the contract, which is `get_pools` in this case. This method is expected to retrieve information about liquidity pools available in the DEX.\n   - The third parameter is an object that contains the input parameters for the method. Here:\n     - `from_index` is set to `0`, indicating that the results should start from the first pool in the list.\n     - `limit` is set to `1000`, meaning the method should return up to 1000 pools. \n\n### Example Response\n\nThe example response shown in the `<details>` section illustrates the data structure returned by the `get_pools` method. Each object in the response array represents a liquidity pool with various properties:\n\n- **pool_kind**: Indicates the type of pool (e.g., SIMPLE_POOL).\n- **token_account_ids**: An array of token account IDs included in the pool.\n- **amounts**: An array of amounts corresponding to each token in the pool.\n- **total_fee**: The total fee associated with the pool (in basis points).\n- **shares_total_supply**: Total supply of shares for this pool.\n- **amp**: A parameter related to the pool's amplification factor (commonly used in certain DEX designs).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis code snippet is a straightforward example of how to interact with a smart contract on NEAR Protocol to fetch liquidity pool information from a DEX. The use of `Near.view()` allows developers to easily retrieve data without incurring costs associated with state changes, which is essential for applications that require real-time data from the blockchain. \n\nIf you have any more questions or need further clarification about NEAR or this specific code, feel free to ask!"}]}

Let’s go through the key components of the code step-by-step:\n\n### Key Components Explained\n\n1. **`receipt_failures` Method**:\n   ```rust\n   pub fn receipt_failures(&self) -> Vec<&ExecutionOutcome> {\n       self.details.receipt_failures()\n   }\n   ```\n   - This method retrieves only the failed receipt outcomes from the execution details. It returns a vector of references to `ExecutionOutcome` objects that indicate failures.\n\n2. **`logs` Method**:\n   ```rust\n   pub fn logs(&self) -> Vec<&str> {\n       self.details.logs()\n   }\n   ```\n   - This method retrieves logs generated during the execution of both the transaction and the receipt outcomes. It returns a vector of string slices representing the logs.\n\n3. **`ViewResultDetails` Struct**:\n   ```rust\n   #[derive(PartialEq, Eq, Clone, Debug)]\n   #[non_exhaustive]\n   pub struct ViewResultDetails {\n       pub result: Vec<u8>, // The result of the view function call\n       pub logs: Vec<String>, // Logs generated from the view function\n   }\n   ```\n   - This struct represents the result obtained from calling a view function on a smart contract. It contains the result as a byte vector (`result`) and any logs generated during the execution (`logs`).\n\n4. **Methods for Deserialization**:\n   ```rust\n   pub fn json<T: serde::de::DeserializeOwned>(&self) -> Result<T> {\n       serde_json::from_slice(&self.result).map_err(|e| ErrorKind::DataConversion.custom(e))\n   }\n   ```\n   - This method allows deserializing the `result` field from JSON into a specified type `T`. It uses the `serde_json` crate for deserialization and maps any errors to a custom error type.\n\n   ```rust\n   pub fn borsh<T: borsh::BorshDeserialize>(&self) -> Result<T> {\n       borsh::BorshDeserialize::try_from_slice(&self.result)\n           .map_err(|e| ErrorKind::DataConversion.custom(e))\n   }\n   ```\n   - Similarly, this method deserializes the `result` field using the Borsh serialization format. It provides another way to convert the byte array into a usable data structure.\n\n5. **`ExecutionOutcome` Struct**:\n   ```rust\n   #[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]\n   #[non_exhaustive]\n   pub struct ExecutionOutcome {\n       pub transaction_hash: CryptoHash,\n       pub block_hash: CryptoHash,\n       pub logs: Vec<String>,\n       pub receipt_ids: Vec<CryptoHash>,\n       pub gas_burnt: Gas,\n       pub tokens_burnt: NearToken,\n       pub executor_id: AccountId,\n       pub(crate) status: ExecutionStatusView,\n   }\n   ```\n   - This struct encapsulates the outcome of a transaction execution. It includes metadata such as transaction and block hashes, logs, gas burnt, tokens burnt, the executor's account ID, and the execution status.\n\n6. **Outcome Check Methods**:\n   ```rust\n   pub fn is_success(&self) -> bool {\n       matches!(self.status, ExecutionStatusView::SuccessValue(_) | ExecutionStatusView::SuccessReceiptId(_))\n   }\n   ```\n   - Checks if the execution outcome was successful by matching the `status` against success variants.\n\n   ```rust\n   pub fn is_failure(&self) -> bool {\n       matches!(self.status, ExecutionStatusView::Failure(_) | ExecutionStatusView::Unknown)\n   }\n   ```\n   - Checks if the execution outcome was a failure by matching against failure or unknown status.\n\n7. **`into_result` Method**:\n   ```rust\n   pub fn into_result(self) -> Result<ValueOrReceiptId> {\n       match self.status {\n           ExecutionStatusView::SuccessValue(value) => Ok(ValueOrReceiptId::Value(Value::from_string(general_purpose::STANDARD.encode(value)))),\n           ExecutionStatusView::SuccessReceiptId(hash) => Ok(ValueOrReceiptId::ReceiptId(CryptoHash(hash.0))),\n           ExecutionStatusView::Failure(err) => Err(ErrorKind::Execution.custom(err)),\n           ExecutionStatusView::Unknown => Err(ErrorKind::Execution.message(\"Unknown execution state\")),\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n   - This method converts the `ExecutionOutcome` into a `Result` type, allowing consumers to handle both success and failure cases more conveniently. It distinguishes between successful results and errors, returning the appropriate type based on the execution outcome.\n\n### Summary\nThe code snippet provides essential functionality for handling execution outcomes and results from view function calls in NEAR smart contracts. It includes methods for fetching logs, checking success or failure of transactions, deserializing results, and encapsulating the execution state along with associated metadata. Understanding this code is crucial for developers working with NEAR's smart contracts, as it provides foundational elements for managing the results of contract interactions."}]}

You can install `nearup` by following the instructions at https://github.com/near-guildnet/nearup.\n\n---\n\n### Steps to Run an RPC Node using `nearup`\n\nRunning a RPC node is very similar to running a [validator node](/validator/running-a-node) as both types of node use the same `nearcore` release. The main difference for running a validator node is requiring `validator_key.json` to be used by the validator node to support its work of validating blocks and chunks on the network.\n\n\nFirst, clone the `nearcore` repo:\n\n```text\ngit clone https://github.com/near/nearcore.git\ncd nearcore\n```\nCheckout the version you wish to build:\n\n```bash\ngit checkout <version>\n```\n\nYou can then run:\n\n```bash\nmake neard\n```\n\nThis will compile the `neard` binary for the version you have checked out, it will be available under `target/release/neard`.\n\nNote that compilation will need over 1 GB of memory per virtual core\nthe machine has. If the build fails with processes being killed, you\nmight want to try reducing number of parallel jobs, for example:\n`CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=8 make neard`.\n\nNB. Please ensure you build releases through `make` rather than `cargo\nbuild --release`.  The latter skips some optimizations (most notably\nlink-time optimisation) and thus produces a less efficient executable.\n\n\n```bash\nnearup run testnet --binary-path path/to/nearcore/target/release\n```\n\nYou will then be prompted for an Account ID below. You should leave this empty as you are running an RPC node, not a validator node.\n\n```text\nEnter your account ID (leave empty if not going to be a validator):\n```\n\nWait until initialization finishes, use the following command to follow logs:\n```bash\n  $ nearup logs --follow\n```\nThen run:\n```bash\n  $ nearup stop\n```\n\nRetrieve a copy of the latest RPC snapshot from S3 using rclone:\nPrerequisite:\n\nRecommended download client [`rclone`](https://rclone.org).\nThis tool is present in many Linux distributions.

Below is a detailed breakdown of key components and steps described in the snippet:\n\n### Overview\n\nThe document serves as a guide for developers who wish to set up an RPC node on NEAR's testnet or localnet using the `nearup` tool. It emphasizes that `nearup` is not suitable for mainnet operations and recommends using `Neard` for mainnet setups.\n\n### Important Sections\n\n1. **Prerequisites**:\n   - **Git**: A version control system needed to clone the `nearcore` repository.\n   - **Nearup**: A tool specifically designed to run NEAR testnet and localnet nodes. It is essential to ensure that `nearup` is installed correctly.\n\n2. **Steps to Run an RPC Node**:\n   - **Cloning the Repository**: \n     ```bash\n     git clone https://github.com/near/nearcore.git\n     cd nearcore\n     ```\n     This command clones the `nearcore` repository, where core functionalities of the NEAR blockchain are implemented.\n   \n   - **Checkout Version**:\n     ```bash\n     git checkout <version>\n     ```\n     Here, you specify the version of the NEAR protocol you wish to build. Replace `<version>` with the actual tag or branch name.\n\n   - **Building the Binary**:\n     ```bash\n     make neard\n     ```\n     This command compiles the NEAR daemon (`neard`) from the source code. The resulting binary will be located in the `target/release` directory. The documentation notes the memory requirements for the build process and suggests using fewer parallel jobs if the build fails due to resource constraints.\n\n   - **Running the Node**:\n     ```bash\n     nearup run testnet --binary-path path/to/nearcore/target/release\n     ```\n     This command starts the RPC node using `nearup` and specifies the path to the compiled `neard` binary. It prompts for an account ID, which should be left empty since this is an RPC node, not a validator node.\n\n   - **Monitoring Logs**:\n     ```bash\n     nearup logs --follow\n     ```\n     This command allows you to follow the logs of your running node, which is useful for debugging and monitoring the node's activity.\n\n   - **Stopping the Node**:\n     ```bash\n     nearup stop\n     ```\n     This command is used to gracefully stop the running node.\n\n3. **Retrieving RPC Snapshot**:\n   - **Using `rclone`**: \n     The snippet instructs you to install `rclone`, a command-line tool for managing files on cloud storage. It emphasizes the need to configure `rclone` to access the NEAR protocol's S3 bucket for downloading the latest RPC snapshot.\n   \n   - **Configuration**:\n     You create a configuration file to set up `rclone` with necessary parameters to access the S3 bucket:\n     ```bash\n     mkdir -p ~/.config/rclone\n     touch ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf\n     ```\n     The configuration specifies access to the NEAR cloudfront.\n\n   - **Downloading the Snapshot**:\n     ```bash\n     rclone copy --no-check-certificate near_cf://near-protocol-public/backups/testnet/rpc/latest ./\n     ```\n     This command retrieves the latest snapshot from the specified S3 bucket path.\n\n4. **Final Command to Start Syncing**:\n   ```bash\n   nearup run testnet\n   ```\n   This command starts the NEAR node and begins the process of syncing the blockchain headers.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis documentation provides a step-by-step guide for developers to set up an RPC node using `nearup`, including prerequisites, commands for cloning and building the necessary software, and how to configure and run the node effectively. Following these steps will enable developers to interact with the NEAR blockchain in a test environment, which is essential for development and testing purposes."}]}

This snippet seems to be part of a JavaScript/TypeScript class related to managing NEAR accounts and interacting with smart contracts on the NEAR blockchain.\n\n### Explanation of Key Portions\n\n1. **Patching State Records:**\n   ```typescript\n   await account.patchStateRecords(records);\n   ```\n   This line is calling the `patchStateRecords` method on the `account` object with `records` as an argument. This likely updates or adds state records associated with the account, which is important for maintaining the state of the contract or account on the NEAR blockchain.\n\n2. **Account Existence Check:**\n   ```typescript\n   if (!await this.provider.accountExists(refContract)) {\n      await account.patchStateRecords(records);\n      if (!await this.provider.accountExists(refContract)) {\n        throw new Error(`Account ${refContract} does not exist after trying to patch into sandbox.`);\n      }\n   }\n   ```\n   Here, the code checks whether an account (referred to as `refContract`) exists using the `accountExists` method of the `provider`. If the account does not exist, it tries to patch the state records again and checks once more. If the account still does not exist, it throws an error. This is a safeguard to ensure that the account is properly created or updated.\n\n3. **Fetching Raw Data:**\n   ```typescript\n   if (withData) {\n      const rawData = await rpc.viewStateRaw(account.accountId, '', blockQuery);\n      const data = rawData.map(({key, value}) => ({\n        Data: {\n          account_id: account.accountId, data_key: key, value,\n        },\n      }));\n      await account.patchStateRecords({records: data});\n   }\n   ```\n   If the `withData` flag is true, it fetches the raw state data for the given account using `rpc.viewStateRaw()`. The `rawData` is then mapped to a new format that includes the account ID, key, and value, which is subsequently patched into the account's state records.\n\n4. **Creating Sub Accounts:**\n   ```typescript\n   getSubAccount(accountId: string): NearAccount {\n      const id = this.makeSubAccount(accountId);\n      return this.getAccount(id);\n   }\n   ```\n   This method generates a sub-account using a given `accountId`. It derives the sub-account ID using `makeSubAccount` and retrieves the corresponding `NearAccount` instance.\n\n5. **Account Creation:**\n   ```typescript\n   async devCreateAccount({\n      initialBalance,\n      keyPair,\n   }: {\n      initialBalance?: BN | string;\n      keyPair?: KeyPair;\n   } = {}): Promise<NearAccount> {\n      const accountId = `${randomAccountId('dev-', 5, 5)}.${this.accountId}`;\n      const tx = await this.internalCreateAccount(accountId, {\n         keyPair,\n         initialBalance,\n      });\n\n      const result = await tx.transact();\n      if (result.Failure) {\n         throw new Error(`Failure during account creation, details: ${JSON.stringify(result)}`);\n      }\n\n      return this.getAccount(accountId);\n   }\n   ```\n   This asynchronous function creates a new account with an optional initial balance and key pair. It generates a random account ID, internally creates the account, and checks the transaction result for failures.\n\n6. **Deploying a Contract:**\n   ```typescript\n   async devDeploy(\n      wasm: string | URL | Uint8Array | Buffer,\n      {\n         attachedDeposit = NO_DEPOSIT,\n         args = {},\n         gas = DEFAULT_FUNCTION_CALL_GAS,\n         initialBalance,\n         keyPair,\n         method,\n         isSubAccount,\n      }: {\n         args?: Record<string, unknown> | Uint8Array;\n         attachedDeposit?: string | BN;\n         gas?: string | BN;\n         initialBalance?: BN | string;\n         keyPair?: KeyPair;\n         method?: string;\n         isSubAccount?: boolean;\n      } = {},\n   ): Promise<NearAccount> {\n      // Similar logic to devCreateAccount, but also deploys a WASM contract.\n   }\n   ```\n   This method handles the deployment of a smart contract (WASM file) to the created account. It takes various parameters, including gas and attached deposits. It creates the account first, deploys the contract, and if a method is specified, it calls that method.\n\n7. **Calling Smart Contract Methods:**\n   ```typescript\n   async callRaw(\n      contractId: NearAccount | string,\n      methodName: string,\n      args: Record<string, unknown> | Uint8Array,\n      {\n         gas = DEFAULT_FUNCTION_CALL_GAS,\n         attachedDeposit = NO_DEPOSIT,\n         signWithKey = undefined,\n      }: {\n         gas?: string | BN;\n         attachedDeposit?: string | BN;\n         signWithKey?: KeyPair;\n      } = {},\n   ): Promise<TransactionResult> {\n      return this.batch(contractId)\n         .functionCall(methodName, args, {gas, attachedDeposit})\n         .transact(signWithKey);\n   }\n   ```\n   This function calls a specified method on a smart contract. It constructs a transaction with the method name and arguments, manages gas and attached deposits, and executes the transaction.\n\n8. **Logging Transaction Results:**\n   ```typescript\n   if (!env.NEAR_WORKSPACES_NO_LOGS && txResult.logs.length > 0) {\n      const accId = typeof contractId === 'string' ? contractId : contractId.accountId;\n      console.log(`Contract logs from ${accId}.${methodName}(${JSON.stringify(args)}) call:`, txResult.logs);\n   }\n   ```\n   After calling a method on a contract, it checks if there are any logs generated during the transaction. If logging is enabled, it prints the logs to the console, which is useful for debugging.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis code snippet is part of a class that provides functionalities for managing NEAR accounts and interacting with smart contracts. It includes methods for creating accounts, deploying contracts, calling contract methods, and handling state updates. The use of asynchronous programming (with `async/await`) and error handling indicates a focus on robust and efficient blockchain interactions. Each method is designed to facilitate developers in creating and managing their dApps on the NEAR protocol efficiently."}]}

Here's a breakdown of how to decode and understand this snippet:\n\n### Step 1: Decode the Base64 String\n\nThe string you provided can be decoded using a base64 decoder. In JavaScript, you can use the `atob` function to decode it:\n\n```javascript\nconst base64Icon = \"LjY4NTYgOS4yMDg1QzE4LjEwMzQgOS4yMDg1IDE3LjYzMTMgOS42NzQ5NiAxNy42MzEzIDEwLjI1MDRDMTcuNjMxMyAxMC44MjU4IDE4LjEwMzQgMTEuMjkyMyAxOC42ODU2IDExLjI5MjNaIiBmaWxsPSIjMjA0MUUwIj48L3BhdGg+Cjwvc3ZnPgo=\";\nconst decodedIcon = atob(base64Icon);\nconsole.log(decodedIcon);\n```\n\n### Step 2: Understanding the Decoded SVG\n\nOnce decoded, the resulting string is an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) representation of an icon. SVG is a vector image format for two-dimensional graphics that supports interactivity and animation. Here’s a simplified view of what the SVG might look like (the actual decoded content can be quite long):\n\n```xml\n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n  <path d=\"M17.63 9.2085C18.1034 9.2085 17.6313 9.674996 17.6313 10.2540C17.6313 10.8258 18.1034 11.2923 18.6856 11.2923\" fill=\"#2041E0\"></path>\n</svg>\n```\n\n### Step 3: Explanation of SVG Elements\n\n- **`<svg>`**: This is the root element of the SVG. It defines the XML namespace for the SVG content and specifies the width and height of the icon.\n- **`viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"`**: This attribute sets up a coordinate system for the SVG. It defines a rectangle that the SVG content will fit into.\n- **`<path>`**: This element is used to define a shape in the SVG. The `d` attribute contains a series of commands and parameters that describe the shape's outline.\n- **`fill=\"#2041E0\"`**: This attribute sets the fill color of the path to a specific hex color code.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe original code snippet is a base64-encoded SVG icon used in the NEAR Protocol ecosystem. When decoded, it provides a graphical representation that can be rendered in web applications, enabling developers to integrate visual elements into their dApps easily. Understanding how to decode and manipulate SVG assets is essential for creating rich user interfaces in decentralized applications."}]}

It employs the `ava` testing framework to verify various functionalities of the fungible token contract. Here's a breakdown of each test case in the snippet:\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n1. **ft_transfer with Unregistered Account**:\n   ```javascript\n   await root.call(\n     ft,\n     \"ft_transfer\",\n     { receiver_id: alice.accountId, amount: \"1\" },\n     { attachedDeposit: NEAR.from(\"1\").toJSON() }\n   );\n   ```\n   - This block attempts to transfer 1 unit of fungible tokens from the `root` account to `alice`.\n   - The `attachedDeposit` specifies a fee for the transaction.\n   - If `alice` is not registered, an error is expected, which is caught in the `catch` block, confirming that the error message indicates `alice` is unregistered.\n\n2. **Owner Balance at Initialization**:\n   ```javascript\n   test(\"Owner has all balance in the beginning\", async (t) => {\n     const { ft, root } = t.context.accounts;\n     const result = await ft.view(\"ft_balance_of\", { account_id: root.accountId });\n     t.is(result, \"1000\");\n   });\n   ```\n   - This test checks if the `root` account starts with a total balance of 1000 tokens, verifying the initial state of the contract.\n\n3. **Transfer with Sufficient Balance**:\n   ```javascript\n   test(\"Can transfer if balance is sufficient\", async (t) => {\n     const { alice, ft, root } = t.context.accounts;\n     await alice.call(\n       ft,\n       \"storage_deposit\",\n       { account_id: alice.accountId },\n       { attachedDeposit: NEAR.parse(\"1 N\").toJSON() }\n     );\n     await root.call(\n       ft,\n       \"ft_transfer\",\n       { receiver_id: alice.accountId, amount: \"100\" },\n       { attachedDeposit: NEAR.from(\"1\").toJSON() }\n     );\n     const aliBalance = await ft.view(\"ft_balance_of\", { account_id: alice.accountId });\n     t.is(aliBalance, \"100\");\n     const ownerBalance = await ft.view(\"ft_balance_of\", { account_id: root.accountId });\n     t.is(ownerBalance, \"900\");\n   });\n   ```\n   - This test verifies that a transfer of 100 tokens from `root` to `alice` can occur when `alice` has deposited for storage.\n   - It checks both `alice`'s new balance (should be 100) and `root`'s new balance (should be 900).\n\n4. **Transfer with Insufficient Balance**:\n   ```javascript\n   test(\"Cannot transfer if balance is not sufficient\", async (t) => {\n     const { alice, root, ft } = t.context.accounts;\n     await alice.call(\n       ft,\n       \"storage_deposit\",\n       { account_id: alice.accountId },\n       { attachedDeposit: NEAR.parse(\"1 N\").toJSON() }\n     );\n     try {\n       await alice.call(\n         ft,\n         \"ft_transfer\",\n         {\n           receiverId: root.accountId,\n           amount: \"100\",\n         },\n         { attachedDeposit: NEAR.from(\"1\").toJSON() }\n       );\n     } catch (e) {\n       t.assert(\n         e\n           .toString()\n           .indexOf(\n             \"Smart contract panicked: assertion failed: The account doesn't have enough balance\"\n           ) >= 0\n       );\n     }\n   });\n   ```\n   - This test ensures that if `alice` tries to transfer 100 tokens without sufficient balance, the smart contract throws an appropriate error message.\n\n5. **Cross Contract Transfer**:\n   ```javascript\n   test(\"Cross contract transfer\", async (t) => {\n     const { xcc, ft, root } = t.context.accounts;\n     await xcc.call(\n       ft,\n       \"storage_deposit\",\n       { account_id: xcc.accountId },\n       { attachedDeposit: NEAR.parse(\"1 N\").toJSON() }\n     );\n     await root.call(\n       ft,\n       \"ft_transfer_call\",\n       { receiver_id: xcc.accountId, amount: \"900\", memo: null, msg: \"test msg\" },\n       { gas: 200000000000000, attachedDeposit: NEAR.from(\"1\").toJSON() }\n     );\n     const xccBalance = await ft.view(\"ft_balance_of\", { account_id: xcc.accountId });\n     t.is(xccBalance, \"900\");\n     const aliSubContractData = await xcc.view(\"get_contract_data\");\n     t.is(\n       aliSubContractData,\n       `[900 from ${root.accountId} to ${xcc.accountId}] test msg `\n     );\n     const ownerBalance = await ft.view(\"ft_balance_of\", { account_id: root.accountId });\n     t.is(ownerBalance, \"100\");\n   });\n   ```\n   - This last test checks the functionality of cross-contract token transfers. It tests if the `root` account can transfer 900 tokens to the `xcc` account and verifies the balances accordingly.\n   - Additionally, it checks that the `xcc` contract correctly records the transfer's metadata.\n\n### Conclusion\nEach test in the snippet is designed to validate different aspects of the fungible token contract's functionality, such as initial balances, the ability to transfer tokens under various conditions, and cross-contract interactions. Understanding these tests is crucial for ensuring that the fungible token implementation adheres to expected behaviors and handles edge cases properly."}]}

In the context of the NEAR Protocol and the file path you've specified (`packages/ethereum-wallets/src/lib/icon.ts`), it seems to relate to the handling of Ethereum wallet icons within the NEAR ecosystem.\n\n### Breakdown of the Code Snippet\n\n1. **Encoding Format**:\n   - The string is encoded in Base64, which is a common method for encoding binary data (like images) into ASCII string format. This is useful for embedding images directly into code or transferring them over protocols that may not handle binary data well.\n\n2. **Usage Context**:\n   - Given that this snippet is located in a file likely related to Ethereum wallets, it's reasonable to assume that this string represents the icon for a specific Ethereum wallet or a generic wallet icon. It could be rendered in a user interface where wallet selection or identification is necessary.\n\n3. **Decoding**:\n   - To visualize or use this icon within your application, you would need to decode the Base64 string back into binary data (an image). In JavaScript, for example, you could use it as follows:\n\n   ```javascript\n   // Example of how to decode and use the Base64 string\n   const base64String = \"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\";\n   const imgElement = document.createElement('img');\n   imgElement.src = `data:image/png;base64,${base64String}`; // Assuming the icon is a PNG image\n   document.body.appendChild(imgElement); // Adds the image to the document\n   ```\n\n4. **Potential Security Considerations**:\n   - When using Base64-encoded content, especially if it is user-generated or comes from an untrusted source, be cautious of potential XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) or other security vulnerabilities. It's essential to validate and sanitize any data before rendering it in your applications.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The specific line of code you provided is a long Base64 string likely representing an image. Depending on its intended use, decoding it and rendering it as an image element in a web application would be a common approach. Understanding how to work with Base64 encoding and decoding is crucial for developers working with web technologies and blockchain applications like those in the NEAR ecosystem."}]}

But the main point is to show how inflation gets affected by usage. Note that even though 1 billion transactions per day is a pretty large number for existing blockchains, that’s about ~11k tx per second of sustained load (also these tx are benchmarked as payment tx; more complex smart contract calls will require more gas and cost more). Bitcoin pioneered cryptocurrencies and the idea of fixed supply. At the same time, constant reduction in security rewards available to miners creates interesting issues long term with the longest chain consensus (for more details read this paper ). In NEAR Protocol, we addressed this issue by guaranteeing a constant security reward rate to Validators. And instead of issuance declining independent of the usage, NEAR’s issuance declines with more usage of the network. Also note that in comparison to Bitcoin and Ethereum, token holders can avoid inflation by delegating/validating with their stake, preserving their percentage or even increasing it (see details in the “Validators” section). Network Usage Transaction fees Each transaction takes some amount of bandwidth to be included in the block and computation to be executed. We combine both of these resources into a unified measure called “gas” that Validators must spend to execute a transaction. NEAR uses WebAssembly Virtual Machine (VM) to execute transactions and provides a mapping from each VM operation to the amount of gas it spends. The goal for gas is to represent a unified measure of resources spent to receive, execute, and propagate a transaction on default hardware. Users who want to send such a transaction must pay a transaction fee, which is computed based on the amount of gas that the transaction will require multiplied by the current gas price. Gas price is defined systemwide and changes from block to block in a predictable manner. Specifically, if the previous block used more than ½ of the gas limit for that block, the gas price is increased by a small margin. Otherwise, the gas price will decrease. There is also a minimum gas price which provides a floor for the price. Minimum gas price is selected to provide a cheap transaction price for users and developers, with the expectation of collecting ~0.1 Ⓝ per full chunk (part of the block from a shard, see Nightshade for more detail). This is designed to make blockchain usage more accessible. Instead of the economy of the scarcity of transaction processing (how it works in Bitcoin and Ethereum), the goal of this system is to hit the economy of scale by increasing the number of shards. Validators when including transactions do not use fees for ordering, instead, there is a deterministic ordering based on transaction hash. As explained in the “Issuance” section, fees that are collected from transactions are burned instead of being redistributed within the network of Validators. This is done for a few reasons: In the Proof-of-Stake network, every validator does the same amount of work by executing and validating transactions; the block producer is not all that special to be rewarded. In the case of a sharded network, it’s even more complicated to distribute these fees, as there are also receipts between shards where gas is bought when a transaction arrives but executed by different Validators. Validators are still incentivized from burning transaction fees as that directly increases their yield. For simple example, let’s say total supply is 100, 50 of which is staked. Let’s 5 tokens are paid in epoch reward, then if there are no fees – yield is (55/105)/(50/100)-1~=4.76%. While if there were 5 tokens of fees burned, yield would be (55/100)/(50/100)-1~=10%. This also incentivizes locking of tokens in other applications by offsetting the issuance.

Key points include:\n\n1. **Token Supply and Inflation**:\n   - NEAR uses \"yocto NEAR\" as the smallest unit, allowing for fine granularity in exchange price resolution, even with significant reductions in overall token supply.\n   - A table illustrates how daily transaction volumes affect annual inflation rates, showing that increased usage can lead to decreased inflation rates.\n\n2. **Security and Validator Rewards**:\n   - Unlike Bitcoin, which experiences a decline in miner rewards, NEAR ensures a constant security reward rate for validators. This is designed to adjust issuance based on network usage rather than a fixed supply model.\n\n3. **Transaction Fees and Gas**:\n   - Each transaction consumes bandwidth and computation, measured in \"gas.\" The gas cost influences the transaction fee, calculated by multiplying the gas required by the current gas price.\n   - The gas price fluctuates based on block usage, increasing or decreasing predictably. A minimum gas price ensures accessibility for users.\n\n4. **Fee Structure**:\n   - Transaction fees are burned rather than redistributed among validators, aligning incentives within the Proof-of-Stake system. This burning mechanism can enhance validator yield by reducing total supply.\n\n5. **Scalability Focus**:\n   - NEAR aims for an economy of scale through increased sharding, contrasting with Bitcoin and Ethereum's scarcity model for transaction processing.\n\nOverall, NEAR Protocol’s design aims to balance economic incentives, inflation control, and network efficiency to support a robust decentralized application ecosystem."}]}

Here's a detailed breakdown of the components of the snippet:\n\n### Error Handling\nThe snippet begins with an error response for the `INTERNAL_ERROR` status, which has the following details:\n- **Error Code**: `500`\n- **Description**: Indicates that something went wrong with the node itself or it is overloaded.\n- **Recommendations**: \n  - Try the request again later.\n  - Send the request to a different node.\n  - Check the `error.cause.info` for more details.\n\nThis section helps developers understand how to handle potential errors when making API calls.\n\n### Transaction Status with Receipts\nThis section describes how to query the status of a transaction using the `EXPERIMENTAL_tx_status` method. Here's a breakdown of the key parts:\n\n#### Method Details\n- **Method Name**: `EXPERIMENTAL_tx_status`\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `tx_hash`: This is the hash of the transaction you want to query. A valid hash can be found in explorers like [NearBlocks Explorer](https://testnet.nearblocks.io).\n  - `sender_account_id`: This specifies the account ID of the sender, which helps determine which shard to query for the transaction.\n  - **Optional**: `wait_until`: This parameter sets the minimum execution level required. The default value is `EXECUTED_OPTIMISTIC`. If `wait_until` is set to a value other than `NONE`, the method will wait for the transaction to appear on the blockchain. If it doesn't exist, it will wait until a specified timeout is reached.\n\n#### Practical Example\nThe snippet provides two examples of how to make a transaction status request:\n\n1. **JSON Example**:\n   This is a JSON-RPC request format where you specify the method and parameters in a structured JSON object.\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n     \"id\": \"dontcare\",\n     \"method\": \"EXPERIMENTAL_tx_status\",\n     \"params\": {\n       \"tx_hash\": \"HEgnVQZfs9uJzrqTob4g2Xmebqodq9waZvApSkrbcAhd\",\n       \"sender_account_id\": \"bowen\",\n       \"wait_until\": \"EXECUTED\"\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **HTTPie Example**:\n   This shows how to make the same request using the command-line tool HTTPie.\n   ```bash\n   http post https://rpc.testnet.near.org jsonrpc=2.0 method=EXPERIMENTAL_tx_status params:='{\"tx_hash\": \"HEgnVQZfs9uJzrqTob4g2Xmebqodq9waZvApSkrbcAhd\", \"sender_account_id\": \"bowen\"}' id=dontcare\n   ```\n\n### Example Response\nThe response structure contains:\n- **ID**: Identifier for the request.\n- **jsonrpc**: The version of the JSON-RPC protocol used.\n- **Result**: Contains the transaction's final execution status and the list of receipts associated with the transaction.\n\nHere's a snippet of what the response might look like:\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"123\",\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"result\": {\n    \"final_execution_status\": \"FINAL\",\n    \"receipts\": [\n      {\n        \"predecessor_id\": \"bowen\",\n        \"receipt\": {\n          \"Action\": {\n            \"actions\": [\n              {\n                \"FunctionCall\": {\n                  \"args\": \"eyJhbW91bnQiOiIxMDAwIiwicmVjZWl2ZXJfaWQiOiJib3dlbiJ9\",\n                  \"deposit\": \"0\",\n                  \"gas\": 100000000000000,\n                  \"method_name\": \"transfer\"\n                }\n              }\n            ],\n            \"gas_price\": \"186029458\",\n            \"input_data_ids\": [],\n            \"output_data_receivers\": [],\n            \"signer_id\": \"bowen\",\n            \"signer_public_key\": \"ed25519:2f9Zv5kuyuPM5DCyEP5pSqg58NQ8Ct9uSRerZXnCS9fK\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"receipt_id\": \"FXMVxdhSUZaZftbmPJWaoqhEB9GrKB2oqg9Wgvuyvom8\",\n        \"receiver_id\": \"evgeny.lockup.m0\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, this section of the documentation provides developers with a clear understanding of how to query the status of a transaction on the NEAR blockchain, including how to handle possible errors, how to format requests, and what responses to expect.

Below is a detailed explanation of each section of the code:\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n1. **Object Cloning and Assignment**\n   ```javascript\n   } else {\n     class_instance[key] = obj[key];\n   }\n   const instance_tmp = cloneDeep(class_instance);\n   for (key in obj) {\n     if (\n       typeof class_instance[key] == \"object\" &&\n       !(class_instance[key] instanceof Date)\n     ) {\n       class_instance[key] = instance_tmp[key];\n     }\n   }\n   return class_instance;\n   ```\n   - This code appears to be part of a function that manipulates an instance of a class or object. The first part assigns properties from `obj` to `class_instance`.\n   - `cloneDeep(class_instance)` creates a deep copy of `class_instance` to avoid mutating it directly during the second iteration.\n   - The second loop checks if properties in `class_instance` are objects (excluding Date instances), and if so, it reassigns them from `instance_tmp`.\n\n2. **Account ID Validation**\n   ```javascript\n   /**\n    * Validates the Account ID according to the NEAR protocol\n    * [Account ID rules](https://nomicon.io/DataStructures/Account#account-id-rules).\n    *\n    * @param accountId - The Account ID string you want to validate.\n    */\n   export function validateAccountId(accountId: string): boolean {\n     return (\n       accountId.length >= 2 &&\n       accountId.length <= 64 &&\n       ACCOUNT_ID_REGEX.test(accountId)\n     );\n   }\n   ```\n   - The `validateAccountId` function checks if an account ID complies with NEAR protocol rules:\n     - Length must be between 2 and 64 characters.\n     - Must match a predefined regex (`ACCOUNT_ID_REGEX`), which likely enforces specific character rules.\n\n3. **TextEncoder Class**\n   ```javascript\n   /**\n    * A subset of NodeJS TextEncoder API\n    */\n   export class TextEncoder {\n     encode(s: string): Uint8Array {\n       return env.utf8_string_to_uint8array(s);\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n   - This class mimics the Node.js `TextEncoder` API, providing a method to convert a string to a `Uint8Array` using UTF-8 encoding. The actual encoding logic is delegated to `env.utf8_string_to_uint8array`.\n\n4. **TextDecoder Class**\n   ```javascript\n   /**\n    * A subset of NodeJS TextDecoder API. Only support utf-8 and latin1 encoding.\n    */\n   export class TextDecoder {\n     constructor(public encoding: string = \"utf-8\") {}\n\n     decode(a: Uint8Array): string {\n       if (this.encoding == \"utf-8\") {\n         return env.uint8array_to_utf8_string(a);\n       } else if (this.encoding == \"latin1\") {\n         return env.uint8array_to_latin1_string(a);\n       } else {\n         throw new Error(\"unsupported encoding: \" + this.encoding);\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n   - This class imitates the Node.js `TextDecoder` API, allowing decoding of `Uint8Array` data back into strings. It supports UTF-8 and Latin1 encodings, throwing an error for unsupported encodings.\n\n5. **Bytes Conversion Function**\n   ```javascript\n   /**\n    * Convert a string to Uint8Array, each character must have a char code between 0-255.\n    * @param s - string that with only Latin1 character to convert\n    * @returns result Uint8Array\n    */\n   export function bytes(s: string): Uint8Array {\n     return env.latin1_string_to_uint8array(s);\n   }\n   ```\n   - The `bytes` function converts a Latin1 string into a `Uint8Array`. Each character in the input string must have a character code between 0-255.\n\n6. **String Conversion Functions**\n   ```javascript\n   /**\n    * Convert a Uint8Array to string, each uint8 to the single character of that char code\n    * @param a - Uint8Array to convert\n    * @returns result string\n    */\n   export function str(a: Uint8Array): string {\n     return env.uint8array_to_latin1_string(a);\n   }\n\n   /**\n    * Encode the string to Uint8Array with UTF-8 encoding\n    * @param s - String to encode\n    * @returns result Uint8Array\n    */\n   export function encode(s: string): Uint8Array {\n     return env.utf8_string_to_uint8array(s);\n   }\n\n   /**\n    * Decode the Uint8Array to string in UTF-8 encoding\n    * @param a - array to decode\n    * @returns result string\n    */\n   export function decode(a: Uint8Array): string {\n     return env.uint8array_to_utf8_string(a);\n   }\n   ```\n   - `str`: Converts a `Uint8Array` back to a Latin1 string.\n   - `encode`: Converts a string to a `Uint8Array` using UTF-8 encoding.\n   - `decode`: Converts a `Uint8Array` back to a string using UTF-8 encoding.\n\n7. **Storage Key Interface**\n   ```javascript\n   /**\n    * When implemented, allow object to be stored as collection key\n    */\n   export interface IntoStorageKey {\n     into_storage_key(): string;\n   }\n   ```\n   - This interface defines a contract for objects that can be converted into a storage key, indicating that any implementing class must provide an `into_storage_key` method returning a string.\n\n### Summary\nThis code snippet provides essential functionalities for validating account IDs, encoding/decoding strings, and defining storage keys within the NEAR ecosystem. The utility functions and classes enhance the developer experience by abstracting common data manipulation tasks in a decentralized application context."}]}

The functionality revolves around tracking accounts that have been used as signers or non-signers, allowing for the retrieval and validation of account IDs from a persistent storage (likely a file) on the filesystem. Below is a detailed breakdown of the code snippet:\n\n### Key Components of the Code\n\n1. **Updating the Used Account List**:\n   ```rust\n   .position(|used_account| &used_account.account_id == account_id)\n   .and_then(|position| used_account_list.remove(position))\n   ```\n   - This part searches for an account in the `used_account_list` that matches the given `account_id`.\n   - If found, it removes that account from the list and retrieves its position.\n\n2. **Updating or Creating a Used Account**:\n   ```rust\n   if let Some(mut used_account) = {\n       ...\n   } else {\n       UsedAccount {\n           account_id: account_id.clone(),\n           used_as_signer: account_is_signer,\n       }\n   };\n   ```\n   - If the account was found, it updates the `used_as_signer` field based on the `account_is_signer` flag.\n   - If not found, it creates a new `UsedAccount` struct, initializing it with the provided `account_id` and whether it is used as a signer.\n\n3. **Persisting the Used Account List**:\n   ```rust\n   let used_account_list_path = get_used_account_list_path(credentials_home_dir);\n   if let Ok(used_account_list_buf) = serde_json::to_string(&used_account_list) {\n       let _ = std::fs::write(used_account_list_path, used_account_list_buf);\n   }\n   ```\n   - After updating the list, it serializes the `used_account_list` to a JSON string using `serde_json` and writes it to a file at the path obtained from `get_used_account_list_path`.\n\n4. **Fetching the Used Account List**:\n   ```rust\n   pub fn get_used_account_list(credentials_home_dir: &std::path::Path) -> VecDeque<UsedAccount> {\n       ...\n   }\n   ```\n   - This function reads the JSON file from the specified path and deserializes it back into a `VecDeque` of `UsedAccount` structs. If the file doesn’t exist or is empty, it returns an empty list.\n\n5. **Existence Check of Used Account List**:\n   ```rust\n   pub fn is_used_account_list_exist(credentials_home_dir: &std::path::Path) -> bool {\n       get_used_account_list_path(credentials_home_dir).exists()\n   }\n   ```\n   - This utility function checks if the used account list file exists in the specified directory.\n\n6. **Input Functions**:\n   - Functions like `input_signer_account_id_from_used_account_list` and `input_non_signer_account_id_from_used_account_list` are wrappers that call a common function `input_account_id_from_used_account_list`, passing a boolean indicating whether the account is a signer or not.\n\n7. **Interactive Input for Account ID**:\n   ```rust\n   fn input_account_id_from_used_account_list(\n       ...\n   ) -> color_eyre::eyre::Result<Option<crate::types::account_id::AccountId>> {\n       ...\n   }\n   ```\n   - This function filters the accounts based on whether they are signers if applicable.\n   - It uses the `Text` struct to prompt the user for input, with autocomplete suggestions and validation for the account ID format.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe provided code is designed to manage a list of used accounts efficiently, allowing for easy retrieval, update, and persistence of account information. It integrates user input for selecting accounts, ensuring that only valid account IDs are processed. The use of `serde_json` for serialization and deserialization indicates a focus on maintaining a structured format for account data, facilitating easier management. \n\nThis code is essential for applications that need to keep track of accounts used in transactions or interactions within the NEAR Protocol, providing a robust mechanism for account management."}]}

The class integrates with Playwright, a web automation library, to interact with a web page that handles multi-chain transactions. Below is a detailed breakdown of the code:\n\n### Imports and Type Definitions\n\n```typescript\nimport { Page } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { getFastAuthIframe } from '../../utils/constants';\n\nexport type KeyType = 'domainKey' | 'personalKey' | 'unknownKey';\nexport type AssetType = 'eth' | 'bnb' | 'btc';\n```\n\n- **Imports**: The `Page` class from Playwright is imported to represent a single browser tab or page.\n- **Utility Function**: `getFastAuthIframe` is a utility that presumably retrieves an iframe element related to fast authentication.\n- **Type Definitions**: Two types, `KeyType` and `AssetType`, are defined for the keys and assets involved in the transactions.\n\n### Interfaces\n\n```typescript\ninterface MultiChainResponse {\n  transactionHash?: string;\n  message: string;\n}\n\ntype TransactionDetail = {\n  keyType: KeyType,\n  assetType: AssetType,\n  amount: number,\n  address: string,\n  isFunctionCall?: boolean,\n  useLocalRpc?: boolean\n}\n```\n\n- **`MultiChainResponse` Interface**: Defines the expected structure of the response from a multi-chain transaction, where `transactionHash` is optional.\n- **`TransactionDetail` Type**: Represents the details needed to submit a transaction, including the key type, asset type, amount, address, and optional flags for function calls and local RPC usage.\n\n### Class Definition: `SignMultiChain`\n\n```typescript\nclass SignMultiChain {\n  private readonly page: Page;\n\n  constructor(page: Page) {\n    this.page = page;\n  }\n```\n\n- **Class Initialization**: `SignMultiChain` takes a Playwright `Page` instance in its constructor, allowing it to interact with that specific page.\n\n### Method: `waitForMultiChainResponse`\n\n```typescript\nasync waitForMultiChainResponse(timeout = 240000) {\n  return await Promise.race([\n    this.page.evaluate(() => new Promise((resolve) => {\n      window.addEventListener('message', (event) => {\n        if (event.data.type === 'multiChainResponse') resolve(event.data);\n      });\n    })),\n    new Promise((_, reject) => {\n      setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Timeout waiting for multiChainResponse message event')), timeout);\n    })\n  ]) as Promise<MultiChainResponse>;\n}\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: Waits for a 'multiChainResponse' message from the window or times out after a specified duration (default 4 minutes).\n- **Implementation**: Uses `Promise.race` to handle two promises: one that resolves when the message is received, and another that rejects on timeout.\n\n### Method: `submitTransaction`\n\n```typescript\nasync submitTransaction({\n  keyType, assetType, amount, address, isFunctionCall, useLocalRpc\n}: TransactionDetail) {\n  await this.page.check(`input#${keyType}`);\n  await this.page.check(`input#${assetType.toLowerCase()}`);\n  await this.page.fill('input#amount', `${amount}`);\n  await this.page.fill('input#address', `${address}`);\n  if (isFunctionCall) {\n    await this.page.check('input#isFunctionCall');\n  }\n  if (useLocalRpc) {\n    await this.page.check('input#useLocalRpc');\n  }\n  await this.page.click('button[type=\"submit\"]');\n}\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: Submits a transaction by filling out a form on the page.\n- **Implementation Details**:\n  - Checks the appropriate input elements based on `keyType` and `assetType`.\n  - Fills in the amount and address fields.\n  - Optionally checks the function call and local RPC options if specified.\n  - Finally, clicks the submit button to process the transaction.\n\n### Method: `clickApproveButton`\n\n```typescript\nasync clickApproveButton() {\n  const frame = getFastAuthIframe(this.page);\n  const approveButton = frame.locator('button:has-text(\"Approve\")');\n  await approveButton.waitFor({ state: 'visible' });\n  await approveButton.click();\n}\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: Clicks the \"Approve\" button in the fast authentication iframe.\n- **Implementation**:\n  - Retrieves the iframe context using `getFastAuthIframe`.\n  - Locates the approve button and waits for it to be visible before clicking.\n\n### Method: `closeModal`\n\n```typescript\nasync closeModal() {\n  const closeButton = this.page.getByRole('img', { name: 'close' });\n  await closeButton.click();\n}\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: Closes a modal dialog by clicking on a close button represented as an image.\n- **Note**: The comment suggests considering the replacement of the Ant Design library for customization options and bundle size optimization.\n\n### Method: `submitAndApproveTransaction`\n\n```typescript\nasync submitAndApproveTransaction({\n  keyType, assetType, amount, address\n}: TransactionDetail) {\n  await this.submitTransaction({\n    keyType, assetType, amount, address\n  });\n  await this.clickApproveButton();\n}\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: A convenience method that first submits the transaction and then clicks the approve button.\n- **Implementation**: Calls `submitTransaction` and `clickApproveButton` in sequence.\n\n### Export Statement\n\n```typescript\nexport default SignMultiChain;\n```\n\n- This line exports the `SignMultiChain` class as the default export from the module, making it available for use in other parts of the application.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis class encapsulates the logic for interacting with a web page to perform multi-chain transactions in NEAR's fast authentication context.

These tests ensure the correctness of various functionalities of the `UnorderedMap`, which is a data structure that allows for storage of key-value pairs in no particular order. Below, I will explain each of the tests in detail.\n\n### Test Explanations\n\n1. **Test for Clearing the Map** (`test_clear`)\n   ```rust\n   #[test]\n   pub fn test_clear() {\n       let mut map = UnorderedMap::new(b\"m\");\n       let mut rng = rand_xorshift::XorShiftRng::seed_from_u64(5);\n       for _ in 0..10 {\n           for _ in 0..=(rng.gen::<u64>() % 20 + 1) {\n               let key = rng.gen::<u64>();\n               let value = rng.gen::<u64>();\n               map.insert(&key, &value);\n           }\n           assert!(!map.to_vec().is_empty()); // Ensure map is not empty before clearing\n           map.clear(); // Clear the map\n           assert!(map.to_vec().is_empty()); // Ensure map is empty after clearing\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n   - **Purpose**: Tests the `clear` method of the `UnorderedMap`.\n   - **Details**: The map is populated with random key-value pairs, then cleared, and it asserts that the map is indeed empty after the `clear` method is called.\n\n2. **Test for Keys and Values** (`test_keys_values`)\n   ```rust\n   #[test]\n   pub fn test_keys_values() {\n       let mut map = UnorderedMap::new(b\"m\");\n       let mut rng = rand_xorshift::XorShiftRng::seed_from_u64(4);\n       let mut key_to_value = HashMap::new();\n       for _ in 0..400 {\n           let key = rng.gen::<u64>();\n           let value = rng.gen::<u64>();\n           key_to_value.insert(key, value);\n           map.insert(&key, &value);\n       }\n       let actual: HashMap<u64, u64> = HashMap::from_iter(map.to_vec());\n       assert_eq!(\n           actual.keys().collect::<HashSet<_>>(),\n           key_to_value.keys().collect::<HashSet<_>>()\n       );\n       assert_eq!(\n           actual.values().collect::<HashSet<_>>(),\n           key_to_value.values().collect::<HashSet<_>>()\n       );\n   }\n   ```\n   - **Purpose**: Validates that the keys and values in the map match those inserted.\n   - **Details**: It generates random keys and values, adds them to both the `UnorderedMap` and a `HashMap`. Afterward, it asserts that the keys and values collected from the `UnorderedMap` match the original keys and values.\n\n3. **Test for Iteration** (`test_iter`)\n   ```rust\n   #[test]\n   pub fn test_iter() {\n       let mut map = UnorderedMap::new(b\"m\");\n       let mut rng = rand_xorshift::XorShiftRng::seed_from_u64(4);\n       let mut key_to_value = HashMap::new();\n       for _ in 0..400 {\n           let key = rng.gen::<u64>();\n           let value = rng.gen::<u64>();\n           key_to_value.insert(key, value);\n           map.insert(&key, &value);\n       }\n       let actual: HashMap<u64, u64> = map.iter().collect(); // Collecting from iterator\n       assert_eq!(actual, key_to_value); // Ensure the collected map matches the original\n   }\n   ```\n   - **Purpose**: Tests the iterator functionality of the `UnorderedMap`.\n   - **Details**: Similar to the previous test, it ensures that iterating over the `UnorderedMap` yields the same key-value pairs that were inserted.\n\n4. **Test for Iterating with nth Element** (`test_iter_nth`)\n   ```rust\n   #[test]\n   pub fn test_iter_nth() {\n       static DES_COUNT: AtomicUsize = AtomicUsize::new(0);\n\n       #[derive(BorshSerialize)]\n       struct DeserializeCounter(u64);\n\n       impl BorshDeserialize for DeserializeCounter {\n           fn deserialize_reader<R: std::io::Read>(reader: &mut R) -> std::io::Result<Self> {\n               DES_COUNT.fetch_add(1, Ordering::SeqCst);\n               u64::deserialize_reader(reader).map(DeserializeCounter)\n           }\n       }\n\n       let mut map = UnorderedMap::new(b\"m\");\n\n       for i in 0..10 {\n           map.insert(&i, &DeserializeCounter(i));\n       }\n       assert_eq!(DES_COUNT.load(Ordering::SeqCst), 0);\n\n       let collected: Vec<u64> = map.iter().skip(5).take(4).map(|(_, v)| v.0).collect();\n       assert!((4..=5).contains(&DES_COUNT.load(Ordering::SeqCst)));\n       assert_eq!(&collected, &[5, 6, 7, 8]);\n\n       DES_COUNT.store(0, Ordering::SeqCst);\n       let collected: Vec<u64> = map.values().skip(5).take(4).map(|v| v.0).collect();\n       assert!((4..=5).contains(&DES_COUNT.load(Ordering::SeqCst)));\n       assert_eq!(&collected, &[5, 6, 7, 8]);\n   }\n   ```\n   - **Purpose**: Tests the ability to skip and take elements from the iterator.\n   - **Details**: It checks that the number of deserialization operations is as expected when skipping over elements in the map. The test verifies that the correct elements are collected after skipping.\n\n5. **Test for Extending the Map** (`test_extend`)\n   ```rust\n   #[test]\n   pub fn test_extend() {\n       let mut map = UnorderedMap::new(b\"m\");\n       let mut rng = rand_xorshift::XorShiftRng::seed_from_u64(4);\n       let mut key_to_value = HashMap::new();\n       for _ in 0..100 {\n           let key = rng.gen::<u64>();\n           let value = rng.gen::<u64>();\n           key_to_value.insert(key, value);\n           map.insert(&key, &value);\n       }\n       for _ in 0..10 {\n           let mut tmp = vec![];\n           for _ in 0..=(rng.gen::<u64>() % 20 + ...\n   ```\n   - **Purpose**: Tests the `extend` functionality of the `UnorderedMap` (the code is truncated here).\n   - **Details**: This part of the code creates and populates the map and seems to be set up to test an extending operation, although the full implementation is not shown.\n\n### Summary\nThese tests ensure that the `UnorderedMap` behaves correctly regarding insertion, clearing, iteration, key-value integrity, and special cases like skipping elements during iteration. Each test utilizes randomness to cover various scenarios, which is a good practice for robustness in testing data structures. \n\nThis code plays a critical role in maintaining the reliability of the `UnorderedMap` within the NEAR Protocol's SDK, ensuring that developers can use this data structure confidently in their applications."}]}

The `Drain` iterator is a specialized iterator that allows for the removal of elements from the `IterableSet` while iterating over it. Below is a breakdown of the key components of this code:\n\n### Struct Definition: `Drain`\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Debug)]\npub struct Drain<'a, T, H>\nwhere\n    T: BorshSerialize + BorshDeserialize + Ord,\n    H: ToKey,\n{\n    elements: vec::Drain<'a, T>,             // A draining vector iterator for the elements\n    index: &'a mut LookupMap<T, VecIndex, H>, // A mutable reference to the underlying index\n}\n```\n\n- **Generic Parameters**: \n  - `'a`: A lifetime parameter indicating that the `Drain` struct is tied to the lifetime of the `IterableSet`.\n  - `T`: The type of elements in the `IterableSet`, constrained to be serializable and deserializable using Borsh (a serialization format) and must implement `Ord` for ordering.\n  - `H`: A type used for the key in the underlying `LookupMap`, constrained to implement the `ToKey` trait.\n\n- **Fields**:\n  - `elements`: A draining iterator that will allow us to iterate through and remove elements from the `IterableSet`.\n  - `index`: A mutable reference to the `LookupMap` used to track the indices of elements, allowing for efficient access and removal.\n\n### Implementation of `Drain`\n\n#### Constructor\n\n```rust\nimpl<'a, T, H> Drain<'a, T, H>\nwhere\n    T: BorshSerialize + BorshDeserialize + Ord,\n    H: ToKey,\n{\n    pub(crate) fn new(set: &'a mut IterableSet<T, H>) -> Self {\n        Self { \n            elements: set.elements.drain(..), \n            index: &mut set.index \n        }\n    }\n```\n\n- The `new` method creates a new `Drain` instance by taking a mutable reference to an `IterableSet`. It initializes the `elements` field with a draining iterator over the `IterableSet`'s elements and sets the `index` field to a mutable reference to the `IterableSet`'s index.\n\n#### Remaining Elements\n\n```rust\nfn remaining(&self) -> usize {\n    self.elements.remaining()\n}\n```\n\n- This method returns the number of remaining elements in the draining iterator.\n\n### Iterator Implementation\n\nThe `Drain` struct implements the `Iterator` trait:\n\n```rust\nimpl<'a, T, H> Iterator for Drain<'a, T, H>\nwhere\n    T: BorshSerialize + BorshDeserialize + Ord + Clone,\n    H: ToKey,\n{\n    type Item = T;\n\n    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {\n        let key = self.elements.next()?; // Get the next element from the draining iterator\n        self.index.remove(&key);          // Remove it from the index\n        Some(key)                          // Return the element\n    }\n\n    fn size_hint(&self) -> (usize, Option<usize>) {\n        let remaining = self.remaining();\n        (remaining, Some(remaining)) // Provide a hint about the remaining elements\n    }\n\n    fn count(self) -> usize {\n        self.remaining() // Count the remaining elements\n    }\n}\n```\n\n- **next()**: Retrieves the next element from the `elements` draining iterator, removes it from the `index`, and returns it.\n- **size_hint()**: Provides an estimate of the number of remaining elements.\n- **count()**: Returns the total number of remaining elements in the iterator.\n\n### Additional Iterator Traits\n\nThe `Drain` struct also implements the `ExactSizeIterator`, `FusedIterator`, and `DoubleEndedIterator` traits for enhanced functionality:\n\n- **ExactSizeIterator**: Allows for precise counting of elements.\n- **FusedIterator**: Indicates that once the iterator returns `None`, it will continue to return `None`.\n- **DoubleEndedIterator**: Allows for iteration from both ends, implementing the `next_back()` method to retrieve elements from the end of the iterator.\n\n```rust\nfn next_back(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {\n    self.elements.next_back() // Get the next element from the back of the draining iterator\n}\n```\n\n### Summary\n\nThis `Drain` iterator facilitates efficient removal of elements from an `IterableSet` while iterating, ensuring the integrity of the underlying data structures. The iterator correctly handles the removal of elements from both the set and its index, providing a clean and effective way to manage the contents of an `IterableSet` in NEAR's blockchain environment."}]}

Let's break down the key components of the code:\n\n### Imports\n\n```javascript\nconst chalk = require('chalk');\nconst connect = require('../../utils/connect');\nconst inspectResponse = require('../../utils/inspect-response');\nconst { assertCredentials } = require('../../utils/credentials');\nconst { askYesNoQuestion } = require('../../utils/readline');\nconst { DEFAULT_NETWORK } = require('../../config');\n```\n\n- **chalk**: A library used for styling terminal string output, making it easier to read.\n- **connect**: A utility function that establishes a connection to the NEAR network.\n- **inspectResponse**: A utility for inspecting and printing responses from the NEAR API.\n- **assertCredentials**: A function that checks if the user has valid credentials for the specified account.\n- **askYesNoQuestion**: A utility for prompting the user with yes/no questions.\n- **DEFAULT_NETWORK**: A constant representing the default network (mainnet, testnet, etc.) for interactions.\n\n### Command Definition\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n    command: 'delete-key <account-id> <access-key>',\n    desc: 'Delete access key',\n    builder: (yargs) => yargs\n        .option('signWithLedger', {\n            alias: ['useLedgerKey'],\n            desc: 'Use Ledger for signing',\n            type: 'boolean',\n            default: false\n        })\n        .option('ledgerPath', {\n            desc: 'HD key path',\n            type: 'string',\n            default: \"44'/397'/0'/0'/1'\"\n        })\n        .option('networkId', {\n            desc: 'Which network to use. Supports: mainnet, testnet, custom',\n            type: 'string',\n            default: DEFAULT_NETWORK\n        })\n        .option('force', {\n            desc: 'Forcefully delete key even if it is unsafe to do so',\n            type: 'boolean',\n            default: false,\n        }),\n    handler: deleteAccessKey\n};\n```\n\n- **command**: Defines the CLI command `delete-key` that takes two parameters: `account-id` and `access-key`.\n- **desc**: A description of what the command does.\n- **builder**: Configures options that can be passed to the command:\n  - **signWithLedger**: Indicates whether to use a Ledger hardware wallet for signing.\n  - **ledgerPath**: Specifies the HD key path for Ledger.\n  - **networkId**: Allows the user to specify which NEAR network to connect to.\n  - **force**: A flag that, if true, allows the user to delete an access key regardless of safety checks.\n\n### The Handler Function: `deleteAccessKey`\n\n```javascript\nasync function deleteAccessKey(options) {\n    await assertCredentials(options.accountId, options.networkId, options.keyStore, options.useLedgerKey);\n    const near = await connect(options);\n    const account = await near.account(options.accountId);\n    const approval = await isAllApprovalsGranted(account, options.accessKey);\n\n    if (!options.force && !approval) {\n        console.log(chalk`Deletion of {bold.white ${options.accessKey}} key on {bold.white ${options.accountId}} was {bold.red canceled}}`);\n    }\n\n    console.log(chalk`Deleting key {bold.white ${options.accessKey}} on {bold.white ${options.accountId}.}`);\n\n    try {\n        const result = await account.deleteKey(options.accessKey);\n        inspectResponse.prettyPrintResponse(result, options);\n    } catch (error) {\n        if (error.type !== 'DeleteKeyDoesNotExist') throw error;\n        console.log(chalk`\\nKey {bold.white ${options.accessKey}} does {bold.red not exist} on account {bold.white ${options.accountId}}.`);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n- **assertCredentials**: Validates the user's credentials for the specified account.\n- **connect**: Establishes a connection to the NEAR network and retrieves the account object for the given `account-id`.\n- **isAllApprovalsGranted**: Checks if the user has granted the necessary approvals for deleting the access key, especially if it's a Full Access key.\n- **Deletion Logic**: If the deletion is not forced and the necessary approvals are not granted, it cancels the deletion and informs the user.\n- **Deleting the Key**: Attempts to delete the specified access key and prints the result. If the key does not exist, it catches the error and notifies the user.\n\n### Confirmation Functions\n\n```javascript\nfunction confirmDelete(accessKey) {\n    return askYesNoQuestion(\n        chalk`{bold.white Key {bold.blue ${accessKey}} is a Full Access key. Make sure it's not your recovery method. Do you want to proceed? {bold.green (y/n) }}`,\n        false);\n}\n\nfunction confirmLock(accountId, accessKey) {\n    return askYesNoQuestion(\n        chalk`{bold.white Key {bold.blue ${accessKey}} is the last Full Access key on your account. In case of deleting you will not be able to restore access to the account {bold.blue ${accountId}}. Do you want to proceed? {bold.green (y/n) }}`,\n        false);\n}\n```\n\n- **confirmDelete**: Asks the user to confirm deletion of a Full Access key, warning them it might be their recovery method.\n- **confirmLock**: Asks for confirmation if the key being deleted is the last Full Access key, warning that it will lock the account.\n\n### Approval Check Function\n\n```javascript\nasync function isAllApprovalsGranted(account, accessKey) {\n    let accessKeys = await account.getAccessKeys();\n    let fullAccessKeys = accessKeys.filter(accessKey => accessKey.access_key.permission === 'FullAccess');\n\n    if (fullAccessKeys.find(key => key.public_key === accessKey)) {\n        if (!await confirmDelete(accessKey)) { return false; }\n        if (fullAccessKeys.length === 1 && !await confirmLock(account.accountId, accessKey)) { return false; }\n    }\n    return true;\n}\n```\n\n- **isAllApprovalsGranted**: Retrieves all access keys for the account and checks if the provided access key is a Full Access key. If so, it prompts for confirmation to proceed with the deletion. If it’s the last Full Access key, it asks for another confirmation before allowing deletion.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis code provides a robust framework for safely deleting access keys from NEAR accounts while ensuring the user is aware of the potential consequences of their actions—especially regarding Full Access keys. The use of confirmation prompts helps to prevent accidental loss of access to accounts, which is crucial in a decentralized environment."}]}

snippet is part of a configuration module for a NEAR Protocol-related application, likely a command-line interface (CLI) tool. Here's a detailed breakdown and explanation of the key components and their functionality:\n\n### Module Declaration and Type Alias\n```rust\nmod migrations;\n\npub type CliResult = color_eyre::eyre::Result<()>;\n```\n- **`mod migrations;`**: This declares a submodule named `migrations`, which likely contains functionality related to versioning and migrating configuration data.\n- **`CliResult`**: This is a type alias for `color_eyre::eyre::Result<()>`, which is a result type that can handle errors using the `color_eyre` error handling library. It simplifies error management in the CLI by allowing functions to return a consistent result type.\n\n### Imports\n```rust\nuse color_eyre::eyre::{ContextCompat, WrapErr};\nuse std::{io::Write, str::FromStr};\nuse tracing_indicatif::span_ext::IndicatifSpanExt;\n```\n- This section imports various useful components:\n  - **`ContextCompat` and `WrapErr`**: Extensions for better error handling.\n  - **`std::{io::Write, str::FromStr}`**: Standard library traits for I/O operations and string parsing.\n  - **`tracing_indicatif::span_ext::IndicatifSpanExt`**: Likely used for enhanced tracing capabilities in asynchronous contexts.\n\n### Configuration Struct\n```rust\n#[derive(Debug, Clone, serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize)]\npub struct Config {\n    pub credentials_home_dir: std::path::PathBuf,\n    pub network_connection: linked_hash_map::LinkedHashMap<String, NetworkConfig>,\n}\n```\n- **`Config` Struct**: This structure holds the application configuration:\n  - **`credentials_home_dir`**: A `PathBuf` that points to the directory where credentials are stored.\n  - **`network_connection`**: A linked hash map that associates network names (as strings) with their corresponding configurations (of type `NetworkConfig`).\n\n### Default Implementation\n```rust\nimpl Default for Config {\n    fn default() -> Self {\n        // ... initialization logic ...\n    }\n}\n```\n- This implementation defines how to create a default value for `Config`:\n  - It uses the `dirs` crate to find the user's home directory and sets the credentials directory.\n  - It initializes the `network_connection` map with configurations for **mainnet** and **testnet**, defining various parameters such as `rpc_url`, `wallet_url`, etc.\n\n### Network Names Retrieval\n```rust\npub fn network_names(&self) -> Vec<String> {\n    self.network_connection\n        .iter()\n        .map(|(_, network_config)| network_config.network_name.clone())\n        .collect()\n}\n```\n- **`network_names` Method**: This method returns a vector of network names from the `network_connection` map. It iterates over the entries and extracts the `network_name` from each `NetworkConfig`.\n\n### Versioning and Migration\n```rust\npub fn into_latest_version(self) -> migrations::ConfigVersion {\n    migrations::ConfigVersion::V2(self)\n}\n```\n- **`into_latest_version` Method**: This method converts the current configuration into the latest version format, specifically version 2 defined in the `migrations` module.\n\n### Configuration Loading\n```rust\npub fn get_config_toml() -> color_eyre::eyre::Result<Self> {\n    // ... loading logic ...\n}\n```\n- **`get_config_toml` Method**: This method attempts to load a configuration file in TOML format:\n  - It constructs the path to the configuration file in the user's config directory.\n  - If the file does not exist, it writes the default configuration to that path.\n  - It then reads the file's content and attempts to parse it into a configuration version.\n  - If parsing fails and the content can be interpreted as an earlier version (`ConfigV1`), it falls back to that.\n\n### Conclusion\nOverall, this module provides a structured way to manage configurations for a NEAR Protocol CLI tool. It includes default values, handles errors with a robust approach, and supports migration to newer configuration formats. Each section of the code is clearly defined, making it easier for developers to integrate and modify the configuration logic as needed."}]}

Let's break down the code to understand its functionality and structure:\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n```typescript\nemit_many(data: NftContractMetadataUpdate[]) {\n    new_171_v1(data).emit();\n}\n```\n\n1. **Function Purpose**: The `emit_many` function is designed to emit events related to updates in the metadata of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It takes an array of `NftContractMetadataUpdate` objects, which likely contains metadata information pertaining to the NFTs.\n\n2. **Calling `new_171_v1`**: The function calls `new_171_v1(data)` to create a new event. This function takes a single parameter, `event_kind`, which is presumably of type `Nep171EventKind`. The `data` parameter likely needs to be transformed or interpreted to fit this type.\n\n3. **Emitting the Event**: After creating the event with the `new_171_v1` function, it then calls `.emit()` on the returned event object, which triggers the actual emission of the event to the blockchain.\n\n### Supporting Functions\n\nThe snippet also includes two supporting functions:\n\n```typescript\nfunction new_171(version: string, event_kind: Nep171EventKind): NearEvent {\n  return new Nep171Event(version, event_kind);\n}\n```\n\n1. **`new_171` Function**: This function constructs a new `Nep171Event` object, which is defined by the version of the event (a string) and the kind of event (`Nep171EventKind`). This encapsulates the logic for creating an event with a specified version.\n\n```typescript\nfunction new_171_v1(event_kind: Nep171EventKind): NearEvent {\n  return new_171(\"1.0.0\", event_kind);\n}\n```\n\n2. **`new_171_v1` Function**: This function is a specialized version of `new_171`, specifically for version \"1.0.0\". It simplifies the process of creating a `Nep171Event` by pre-defining the version parameter. It only requires the `event_kind` as input.\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Event Emission**: The `emit_many` function is responsible for emitting NFT metadata update events. \n- **Event Creation**: The `new_171` and `new_171_v1` functions facilitate the creation of `Nep171Event` instances with the appropriate versioning.\n- **Event Kind**: The `event_kind` parameter is crucial as it determines what kind of event is being emitted, reflecting the specific metadata changes in the NFT contract.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nHere's a hypothetical example of how `emit_many` might be called:\n\n```typescript\nconst updates: NftContractMetadataUpdate[] = [\n  { name: \"New NFT\", description: \"This is a new NFT.\" },\n  { name: \"Updated NFT\", description: \"This NFT has been updated.\" }\n];\n\nemit_many(updates); // This would emit events for each update provided.\n```\n\nIn this case, the `emit_many` function would take the array of updates and emit events accordingly, notifying the blockchain of the changes."}]}

So after making an invalid bid, we should check that the call was successful but the parties involved in the transaction (the bidder and the contract) have the same balance of fungible tokens as they did before the call.\n\nPrevious to this, Bob made a bid of 60,000 and Alice was returned her bid bringing her balance back up to 150,000. Now when Alice makes an invalid of 50,000 Alice's balance should remain at 150,000 and the contract should remain at a balance of 60,000.\n\n<Tabs groupId=\"code-tabs\">\n\n    <TabItem value=\"js\" label=\"🌐 JavaScript\">\n\n        <Github fname=\"main.ava.js\" language=\"javascript\"\n                url=\"https://github.com/near-examples/auctions-tutorial/blob/main/contract-ts/04-ft-owner-claims-winner-gets-nft/sandbox-test/main.ava.js#L122-L130\"\n                start=\"122\" end=\"130\" />\n\n    </TabItem>\n\n    <TabItem value=\"rust\" label=\"🦀 Rust\">\n\n        <Github fname=\"test_basics.rs\" language=\"rust\"\n                url=\"https://github.com/near-examples/auctions-tutorial/blob/main/contract-rs/04-ft-owner-claims-winner-gets-nft/tests/test_basics.rs#L183-L200\"\n                start=\"183\" end=\"200\" />\n\n    </TabItem>\n\n</Tabs>\n\n---\n\n## Using FTs with the CLI\n\nIf you want to interact with the auction contract you're going to need FTs. For this example, we'll use $DAI where the contract address is `dai.fakes.testnet`. One can easily acquire FTs through the [testnet faucet](https://near-faucet.io/). Select DAI and withdraw to the account you will use to place a bid. If you take a look at the transaction details you can see that the faucet registers your account in the FT contract and then sends you DAI from the faucet account.\n\nWhen deploying the contract make sure to specify the FT contract `dai.fakes.testnet`.\n\nThe auction contract will need to be registered as well, you could do this by sending it an arbitrary amount of $DAI from the faucet or you can just register it since it doesn't need any FTs. You should also register the auctioneer,\n\n```\nnear contract call-function as-transaction dai.fakes.testnet storage_deposit json-args '{\"account_id\": \"<auctionContractId>\"}' prepaid-gas '100.0 Tgas' attached-deposit '0.1 NEAR'\n```\n\nNow you can go ahead and place a bid. DAI has 18 decimals meaning that 1 $DAI is made up of 10^24 smallest units. To make a bid of 2 $DAI you can use the command:\n\n```\nnear contract call-function as-transaction dai.fakes.testnet ft_transfer_call json-args '{\"receiver_id\": \"<auctionContractId>\", \"amount\": \"2000000000000000000\", \"msg\": \"\"}' prepaid-gas '100.0 Tgas' attached-deposit '1 yoctoNEAR'\n```\n\n## Auction architecture \n\nWhen creating an application there are numerous ways to structure it. Here, we have one contract per auction meaning we have to deploy a new contract each time we want to host an auction. To make this easier we will leverage a factory contract to deploy auction contracts for an auctioneer. Deploying code for each auction gets expensive, with 100kb of storage costing 1 $NEAR, since each auction stores all the same type of information and implements the same methods one could instead decide to have multiple auctions per contract. \n\nIn such case, the Contract struct would be a map of auctions. We would implement a method to create a new auction by adding an entry to the map with the specific details of that individual auction.\n\n<Tabs groupId=\"code-tabs\">\n\n    <TabItem value=\"js\" label=\"🌐 JavaScript\">\n\n        ```javascript\n        class Contract {\n            auctions: UnorderedMap<string, Auction>\n        ```\n\n    </TabItem>\n\n    <TabItem value=\"rust\" label=\"🦀 Rust\">\n\n        ```rust \n        pub struct Contract {\n            auctions: IterableMap<String, Auction>\n        ```\n\n    </TabItem>\n\n</Tabs>\n\nHowever, this architecture could be deemed less secure since if a bad actor were to gain access to the contract they would have access to every auction instead of just one.\n\n--- \n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this section, you learned a lot about fungible tokens: how to send and receive FTs in a smart contract, and then in sandbox tests how to deploy and initialize an FT contract, how```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The provided code snippet from the NEAR Protocol documentation discusses the handling of fungible tokens (FTs) in the context of an auction smart contract. Below is a detailed explanation of the key elements and concepts presented in the snippet.\n\n### Key Concepts Explained\n\n1. **Fungible Token Transfer Logic**:\n   - In an auction context, when a participant (e.g., Alice) makes a bid, a transfer of tokens occurs. If the bid is invalid (e.g., not enough tokens or exceeding the limit), the `ft_on_transfer` function will fail. In such cases, the FT contract reverses the token transfer, ensuring that the balances of both the bidder and the auction contract remain unchanged.\n\n2. **Bid Tracking**:\n   - The scenario describes a bidding process where:\n     - Bob previously placed a bid of 60,000 tokens.\n     - Alice’s previous balance of tokens was restored to 150,000 after an invalid bid (which returned her previous bid amount).\n     - When Alice attempts to place another invalid bid of 50,000 tokens, her balance should still reflect 150,000, and the auction contract’s balance should still reflect 60,000.\n\n3. **Code Snippets**:\n   - The documentation provides links to JavaScript and Rust code examples that demonstrate how to implement the described functionalities. These examples can be found in the respective GitHub repository files.\n\n4. **Using FTs with Command Line Interface (CLI)**:\n   - To participate in the auction, users need to acquire FTs (in this case, $DAI) and interact with the auction contract using NEAR's CLI. \n   - Instructions are provided for acquiring $DAI from a testnet faucet and how to register the auction contract with the FT.\n\n5. **Auction Contract Architecture**:\n   - The snippet discusses how to structure auction contracts. There are two approaches:\n     - **One Contract Per Auction**: Each auction has its own contract. This method is straightforward but can be costly due to storage fees on the blockchain.\n     - **Single Contract for Multiple Auctions**: A single contract manages multiple auctions, which can be more efficient. In this case, the contract maintains a map of auctions, allowing it to handle multiple auction instances under one contract. However, it raises security concerns since access to the contract could potentially expose all auctions to a malicious actor.\n\n### Example Code Breakdown\n\nBelow are the simplified examples provided in the snippet, along with explanations:\n\n#### JavaScript Example\n\n```javascript\nclass Contract {\n    auctions: UnorderedMap<string, Auction>\n}\n```\n- This snippet defines a `Contract` class with an `auctions` property, which is an `UnorderedMap`. This map stores auction instances identified by a unique string key.\n\n#### Rust Example\n\n```rust\npub struct Contract {\n    auctions: IterableMap<String, Auction>\n}\n```\n- In Rust, a similar structure is defined with a `Contract` struct. It uses an `IterableMap`, which allows for efficient iteration over the stored auctions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn this section, the documentation provides insight into the interaction with fungible tokens in an auction setting, emphasizing the importance of ensuring that balances remain consistent during invalid transactions. It also discusses architectural choices for auction contracts, balancing efficiency and security. Developers are encouraged to review the linked code examples for practical implementation details. \n\nThis comprehensive understanding helps build robust auction systems leveraging NEAR's blockchain capabilities while adhering to best practices in smart contract development."}]}

This code defines a logging utility class, `Logger`, that allows for various levels of logging messages. Here’s a comprehensive explanation of the code:\n\n### Imports\n```typescript\nimport { ConsoleLogger } from './console.logger';\nimport type { LogLevel, LoggerService } from './interface';\n```\n- The code imports `ConsoleLogger`, which is presumably a class that implements logging functionality to the console.\n- It also imports types `LogLevel` and `LoggerService` from an `interface` file, which likely define the structure of logging levels and the logger service interface.\n\n### Default Logger Configuration\n```typescript\nconst DEFAULT_LOG_LEVELS: LogLevel[] = [\n    'verbose',\n    'debug',\n    'log',\n    'warn',\n    'error',\n    'fatal',\n];\n\nconst DEFAULT_LOGGER = new ConsoleLogger(DEFAULT_LOG_LEVELS);\n```\n- `DEFAULT_LOG_LEVELS` is an array defining the log levels in order of severity, from most verbose (`verbose`) to most critical (`fatal`).\n- `DEFAULT_LOGGER` initializes an instance of `ConsoleLogger` with the defined log levels, making it the default logger used by this utility.\n\n### Logger Class Definition\n```typescript\n/**\n * Used to log the library messages\n */\nexport class Logger {\n    protected static instanceRef?: LoggerService = DEFAULT_LOGGER;\n```\n- The `Logger` class is created to manage logging functions.\n- It has a static property `instanceRef`, which holds an instance of `LoggerService`. It is initialized to `DEFAULT_LOGGER`, meaning if no other logger is provided, it will log to the console.\n\n### Override Logger Method\n```typescript\n    public static overrideLogger = (logger?: LoggerService): void => {\n        this.instanceRef = logger;\n    };\n```\n- The `overrideLogger` method allows users to replace the default logger with a custom logger implementation. This is useful for integrating different logging frameworks or services.\n\n### Logging Methods\nThe class provides several static methods for logging at different levels:\n\n#### Error Logging\n```typescript\n    public static error(message: any, stack?: string): void;\n    public static error(message: any, ...optionalParams: [string, ...any[]]): void;\n    public static error(message: any, ...optionalParams: any[]) {\n        this.instanceRef?.error(message, ...optionalParams);\n    }\n```\n- `error` method has multiple overloads for flexibility in how error messages can be logged.\n- The implementation checks if `instanceRef` is defined and then calls the `error` method on that logger instance.\n\n#### Log Level Methods\nEach of the following methods follows a similar pattern as the `error` method:\n```typescript\n    public static log(message: any, ...optionalParams: any[]) {\n        this.instanceRef?.log(message, ...optionalParams);\n    }\n\n    public static warn(message: any, ...optionalParams: any[]) {\n        this.instanceRef?.warn(message, ...optionalParams);\n    }\n\n    public static debug(message: any, ...optionalParams: any[]) {\n        this.instanceRef?.debug?.(message, ...optionalParams);\n    }\n\n    public static verbose(message: any, ...optionalParams: any[]) {\n        this.instanceRef?.verbose?.(message, ...optionalParams);\n    }\n\n    public static fatal(message: any, stack?: string): void;\n    public static fatal(message: any, ...optionalParams: [string, ...any[]]): void;\n    public static fatal(message: any, ...optionalParams: any[]) {\n        this.instanceRef?.fatal?.(message, ...optionalParams);\n    }\n```\n- Each method corresponds to a log level: `log`, `warn`, `debug`, `verbose`, and `fatal`.\n- They use optional parameters to allow for additional context or metadata to be logged alongside the main message.\n- The use of optional chaining (`?.`) ensures that if `instanceRef` is `undefined`, no error will be thrown, and logging will simply be skipped.\n\n### Summary\nThe `Logger` class is a utility for logging messages at various severity levels within the NEAR ecosystem. By allowing the logger to be overridden, it provides flexibility for developers to integrate with different logging frameworks as needed. Each logging method is designed to ensure that messages can be logged effectively while handling potential absence of the logging instance gracefully."}]}

This collaborative approach can lead to a more robust ecosystem as developers from diverse backgrounds can contribute their expertise.\n\n#### Contract Primitives\n\n```markdown\n## Contract primitives\nContract primitives such as FT, NFT, and DAOs are fundamental building blocks that can be combined to create awesome user experiences such as reward tokens, decision-making tools, and marketplaces.\n```\n\n- **Contract Primitives**: The term \"contract primitives\" refers to basic components of smart contracts that can be used to build more complex applications. \n\n- **FT (Fungible Tokens)**: These are tokens that are interchangeable and can represent assets like currency.\n\n- **NFT (Non-fungible Tokens)**: These tokens are unique and can represent ownership of distinct items, such as digital art.\n\n- **DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations)**: These are organizations or protocols that are run by smart contracts, allowing for decentralized governance and decision-making.\n\n- **User Experiences**: The snippet highlights that these primitives can be combined to create innovative applications, such as reward systems, governance tools, and marketplaces. This showcases the flexibility and potential of the NEAR ecosystem.\n\n#### Tips Section\n\n```markdown\n:::tip\n\nCheck our section on [primitives](../5.primitives/what-is.md) to learn more about them\n:::\n```\n\n- **Tip Section**: This is an instructional note encouraging readers to explore further resources. It directs them to a dedicated section on \"primitives,\" which likely provides in-depth information about the fundamental components discussed.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, the provided code snippet outlines NEAR Protocol's approach to enhancing user experience through higher-level libraries, the importance of community involvement in expanding language support, and the significance of contract primitives as essential building blocks for creating dApps. This documentation is aimed at developers looking to leverage NEAR for building decentralized applications, guiding them toward better understanding and efficient usage of the platform's capabilities."}]}

It models different types of permissions and operations that can be performed on the blockchain. Let's break down the key components of this code to enhance understanding.\n\n### Key Components of the Code\n\n1. **Schema Definition**:\n   Each `Schema` is defined as either a `struct` or an `enum`, which describes the structure of various transaction types and permissions in the NEAR blockchain.\n\n2. **Permissions**:\n   - `FullAccessPermission`: This schema is an empty struct, indicating that it doesn't require any additional information for full access permissions.\n   - `AccessKeyPermission`: This schema is an enum that supports two types of access permissions: `functionCall` (which refers to `FunctionCallPermission`) and `fullAccess`.\n\n3. **Access Key Structure**:\n   - `AccessKey`: This schema contains a `nonce` (for preventing replay attacks) and a `permission` (which is of type `AccessKeyPermission`).\n\n4. **Transaction Actions**:\n   Each action corresponds to a specific operation that can be executed on the blockchain. Here are some examples:\n   - `CreateAccount`: Represents a request to create a new account.\n   - `DeployContract`: Contains a code array for deploying smart contracts.\n   - `FunctionCall`: Represents a function call with attributes like `methodName`, `args`, `gas`, and `deposit`.\n   - Other actions include `Transfer`, `Stake`, `AddKey`, `DeleteKey`, and `DeleteAccount`, each defined with specific parameters.\n\n5. **Delegation of Actions**:\n   - `DelegateAction`: This schema allows for delegating actions to be executed by another account. It includes attributes like `senderId`, `receiverId`, and an array of `actions`.\n   - `SignedDelegate`: Represents a delegated action that includes the `DelegateAction` and its digital signature.\n\n6. **General Action and Transaction Structure**:\n   - `Action`: An enum that encompasses all possible actions that can be performed, including `signedDelegate`.\n   - `Transaction`: This schema encapsulates the overall transaction structure containing fields such as `signerId`, `publicKey`, `nonce`, `receiverId`, `blockHash`, and an array of `actions`.\n\n7. **Signed Transaction**:\n   - `SignedTransaction`: This schema consists of a `Transaction` and its associated `signature`, indicating that the transaction has been signed by the sender.\n\n### Example Breakdown\n\nHere's an example of how one part of the code works:\n\n```typescript\nFunctionCall: Schema = {\n    struct: {\n        methodName: 'string', // Name of the method to be called\n        args: { array: { type: 'u8' } }, // Arguments for the method, represented as an array of bytes\n        gas: 'u64', // Amount of gas to be used for the call\n        deposit: 'u128', // Amount of NEAR tokens to be attached to the call\n    }\n};\n```\n\nIn this schema definition, the `FunctionCall` struct specifies the required parameters for invoking a function in a smart contract. The `methodName` is a string indicating which function to call, `args` is an array of unsigned 8-bit integers (bytes) representing the serialized arguments, `gas` is a 64-bit unsigned integer representing the gas limit for the transaction, and `deposit` is a 128-bit unsigned integer indicating the amount of NEAR to send along with the call.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis code snippet defines a comprehensive structure for various transaction types in the NEAR Protocol, providing a clear and organized way to manage permissions and actions within the blockchain ecosystem. Each schema is carefully designed to facilitate different functionalities, ensuring that developers can easily interact with the NEAR blockchain when building decentralized applications (dApps)."}]}

The `Account` class provides a structured and efficient way to interact with accounts on the NEAR blockchain, supporting various functionalities such as account creation, balance checks, and contract imports. Understanding this code is crucial for developers looking to build decentralized applications (dApps) on the NEAR Protocol."}]}

The `LookupMap` is a key-value store that allows for efficient insertion, retrieval, and deletion of items. Below is a breakdown of the key components and logic in the provided code, along with explanations of each test case.\n\n### Overview of the Code Structure\n\n1. **Testing Insertions and Retrievals:**\n   - The code begins with a loop that performs a series of insertions and checks the integrity of the `LookupMap` by asserting the expected outcomes of retrievals and removals.\n\n2. **Testing `get_mut`:**\n   - The `test_find_mut` function checks if we can get a mutable reference to a value in the `LookupMap` and modify it.\n\n3. **Testing Overwrites:**\n   - The `test_insert_overwrite` function validates that inserting a new value for an existing key overwrites the old value.\n\n4. **Testing Removals:**\n   - The `test_remove` function ensures that when a key is removed, it no longer exists in the map.\n\n5. **Testing Basic Get Functionality:**\n   - The `test_find` function checks the basic retrieval of values from the map.\n\n6. **Testing String Representation:**\n   - The `test_show` function checks the string representation of the `LookupMap`.\n\n7. **Testing Indexing:**\n   - The `test_index` and `test_index_nonexistent` functions verify that values can be accessed using indexing syntax and that accessing a nonexistent key panics.\n\n8. **Testing Entries:**\n   - The `test_entry` function is partially shown, indicating that it will iterate over a set of key-value pairs.\n\n### Key Breakdown of the Tests\n\n#### 1. Loop for Insertion, Retrieval, and Removal\n```rust\nfor _ in 0..10 {\n    for i in 1..1001 {\n        assert!(m.insert(i, i).is_none());\n        // Check if inserting i returns None (meaning it was not present before)\n        \n        for j in 1..=i {\n            let r = m.get(&j);\n            assert_eq!(r, Some(&j)); // Ensure that j is present\n        }\n\n        for j in i + 1..1001 {\n            let r = m.get(&j);\n            assert_eq!(r, None); // Ensure that keys above i are not present\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Additional checks and removals would follow...\n}\n```\n- The outer loop runs the test multiple times (10 iterations) to ensure that the `LookupMap` maintains its integrity across multiple usages.\n- For each `i`, it first asserts that a new insertion of `i` returns `None`, confirming it wasn’t previously present.\n- Then, it checks that all keys from `1` to `i` are present and all keys from `i + 1` to `1000` are absent.\n\n#### 2. Testing `get_mut`\n```rust\nlet new = 100;\nmatch m.get_mut(&5) {\n    None => panic!(),\n    Some(x) => *x = new,\n}\nassert_eq!(m.get(&5), Some(&new));\n```\n- This snippet checks that we can successfully retrieve a mutable reference to the value associated with the key `5` and modify it.\n\n#### 3. Testing Overwrites\n```rust\nassert!(m.insert(1, 2).is_none());\nassert!(m.insert(1, 3).is_some());\nassert_eq!(*m.get(&1).unwrap(), 3);\n```\n- Here, the first insertion of `1` returns `None`, while the second insertion returns `Some(previous_value)`, confirming that the value has been overwritten correctly.\n\n#### 4. Testing Removals\n```rust\nassert_eq!(m.remove(&1), Some(2));\nassert_eq!(m.remove(&1), None);\n```\n- This ensures that removing an existing key returns its value, while removing it again returns `None`.\n\n#### 5. Testing String Representation\n```rust\nlet map_str = format!(\"{:?}\", map);\nassert_eq!(map_str, \"LookupMap { prefix: [98] }\");\n```\n- This validates that the debug representation of the `LookupMap` matches the expected format.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe provided code is a robust suite of unit tests for the `LookupMap` data structure. It effectively validates the core functionalities of insertion, retrieval, overwriting, removal, and mutability within the NEAR SDK. Each test is designed to ensure that edge cases and normal use cases are handled correctly, contributing to the reliability of the `LookupMap` implementation."}]}

Below, I will break down each section of the code for a clearer understanding.\n\n### Overview\nThe document provides several web methods that allow NEAR Components to interact with external data sources, manage local state, and persist data in the browser. It introduces key functionalities such as fetching data, caching it, and utilizing local storage.\n\n### Fetch Method\nThe `fetch` method is a wrapper around the standard browser `fetch` function. It performs the following:\n\n- **Data Retrieval**: It fetches data from a specified URL.\n- **Caching Mechanism**: It returns cached data if available, or fetches in the background if not.\n\n```js\nconst res = fetch(\"https://rpc.mainnet.near.org/status\");\nreturn res.body;\n```\n- In this example, it fetches the status from the NEAR RPC endpoint. The `res.body` will contain the fetched data.\n\n#### Async Version\nThe `asyncFetch` method is the asynchronous equivalent of `fetch`, returning a promise rather than a direct value.\n\n```js\nconst [uptime, setUptime] = useState(null);\n\nfunction reportUptime() {\n  const promise = asyncFetch(\"https://rpc.mainnet.near.org/status\");\n  \n  promise.then(res => { setUptime(res.body.uptime_sec) });\n}\n\nreturn <>\n  <p>{uptime ? `Uptime: ${uptime}s` : `Fetch a value`}</p>\n  <button onClick={reportUptime}>Fetch uptime</button>\n</>\n```\n- Here, the `reportUptime` function triggers an asynchronous fetch call to retrieve the uptime, updating the component state upon success. **Important Note**: Unlike `fetch`, `asyncFetch` does not cache results, so it should be used within a function to avoid multiple fetch calls on re-renders.\n\n### Cache Method\nThe `useCache` hook manages data caching within the component.\n\n```js\nconst status = useCache(\n  () => asyncFetch(\"https://rpc.mainnet.near.org/status\").then((res) => res.body),\n  \"mainnetRpcStatus\",\n  { subscribe: true }\n);\n\nreturn status;\n```\n- It accepts a `promiseGenerator` function that fetches data, a unique `dataKey` for identification, and optional `options` like `subscribe` for periodic updates.\n- The cache behavior can be summarized as:\n  - Returns `null` if the cache is cold.\n  - Returns the cached value while fetching new data.\n  - Returns the new value once fetched.\n\n### LocalStorage Methods\nNEAR Components leverage a simulated `localStorage` through a `Storage` object.\n\n```jsx\nconst [time, setTime] = useState(stored || Date.now());\n\nconst storeValue = () => {\n  const date = Date.now();\n  Storage.set('time_now', date);\n}\n\nreturn <>\n  <p> Time Now: {Date.now()} </p>\n  <p> Time Stored: {Storage.get('time_now')} </p>\n  <button onClick={storeValue}>Store Date.now()</button>\n</>\n```\n- This example shows how to store the current timestamp in local storage and retrieve it. The `storeValue` function saves the current time when invoked.\n\n### Summary\nThe document provides a detailed guide on using web methods in NEAR Components, which include:\n- **Data fetching**: Using `fetch` and `asyncFetch` for synchronous and asynchronous calls.\n- **Caching**: Utilizing `useCache` to store and manage fetched data efficiently.\n- **Local storage**: Accessing and manipulating data in the browser's local storage using the `Storage` object.\n\nThis functionality enables developers to build dynamic applications that can interact seamlessly with external data sources while maintaining efficient state management and data persistence."}]}

This is particularly useful for sharing assets like icons across different components in a web application.\n\n2. **Constant Declaration**:\n   - `const nethIcon`: This declares a constant named `nethIcon`. Using `const` ensures that the reference to this variable cannot be changed later in the code.\n\n3. **Base64 Image Data**:\n   - The string assigned to `nethIcon` starts with `data:image/png;base64,`. This prefix tells browsers that the following data is an image (specifically a PNG) encoded in Base64 format.\n   - The long string following this prefix is the actual Base64-encoded image data. Base64 encoding transforms binary data (like an image) into ASCII string format, which allows it to be easily included in HTML or CSS.\n\n### Usage:\nThis Base64 encoded image can be used directly in HTML or CSS, for example:\n\n```html\n<img src={nethIcon} alt=\"NetH Icon\" />\n```\n\nOr in CSS:\n\n```css\nbackground-image: url(${nethIcon});\n```\n\n### Advantages of Using Base64 Encoding:\n- **Reduced HTTP Requests**: Embedding images directly into HTML or CSS can reduce the number of HTTP requests, which can improve loading times for small images.\n- **Self-Contained**: The image becomes part of the document, making it easier to manage in some cases.\n\n### Considerations:\n- **Size**: Base64 encoding increases the size of the image by approximately 33%. This can be a disadvantage for larger images.\n- **Cache**: Browsers cannot cache Base64 images separately, which may lead to increased load times if the same image is used multiple times across different pages.\n\nThis code snippet is typical in web development where small icons or images are needed frequently, and the convenience of embedding them outweighs the benefits of keeping them as separate files."}]}

See details of the finality gadget [[here]](/docs/PoST.pdf)\n- At least 120 blocks (2-3 minutes) built on top of the block of interest. This is relevant in case of invalid state transition in some shard and provides enough time for state change challenges. In case all shards are tracked and some mechanics to pause across nodes is employed, this is not needed. We recommend exchanges track all shards.\n\n## Accounts\n\n### How are addresses generated?\n\nPlease check out the spec here on accounts https://nomicon.io/DataStructures/Account.html.\n\n### What is the balance record-keeping model on the NEAR platform?\n\nNEAR uses an `Account`-based model. All users and contracts are associated with at least 1 account. Each account lives on a single shard. Each account can have multiple keys for signing transactions.\n\n_You can read [more about NEAR accounts here](https://nomicon.io/DataStructures/Account.html)_\n\n### How are user accounts represented on-chain?\n\nUsers create accounts with human-readable names (eg `alice`) which can contain multiple keypairs with individual permissions. Accounts can be atomically and securely transferred between parties as a native transaction on the network. Permissions are programmable with smart contracts as well. For example, a lock up contract is just an account with permission on the key that does not allow to transfer funds greater than those unlocked.\n\n### Is there a minimum account balance?\n\nTo limit on-chain \"dust\", accounts (and contracts) are charged a refundable deposit for storing data on the chain. This means that if the balance of the account does not have enough balance to cover an increased deposit for additional storage of data, storing additional data will fail. Also, any user can remove their own account and transfer left over balance to another (beneficiary) account.\n\nThere will be a restoration mechanism for accounts removed (or slept) in this way implemented in the future.\n\n### How many keys are used?\n\nAn account can have arbitrarily many keys, as long as it has enough tokens for their storage.\n\n### Which balance look-ups exists? What is required?\n\nWe have an [RPC method for viewing account](/api/rpc/setup#view_account).\n\nThe [JS implementation is here](https://github.com/near/near-api-js/blob/d7f0cb87ec320b723734045a4ee9d17d94574a19/src/providers/json-rpc-provider.ts#L73). Note that in this RPC interface you can specify the finality requirement (whether to query the latest state or finalized state).\n\nFor custody purposes, it is recommended not to rely on latest state but only what is finalized.\n\n## Fees\n\n### What is the fee structure for on-chain transactions? \n\nNEAR uses a gas-based model where prices are generally deterministically adjusted based on congestion of the network.\n\nWe avoid making changes that are too large through re-sharding by changing number of available shards (and thus throughput).\n\nAccounts don’t have associated resources. Gas amount is predetermined for all transactions except function calls. For function call transactions the user (or more likely the developer) attaches the required amount of gas. If some gas is left over after the function call, it is converted back to NEAR and refunded to the original funding account.\n\n### How do we know how much gas to add to a transaction?\n\n- See reference documentation here: https://nomicon.io/Economics/\n- See API documentation for [discovering gas price via RPC here](/api/rpc/setup#gas-price).\n\nThe issuer of a transaction should attach some amount of gas by taking a guess at budget which will get the transaction processed. The contract knows how much to fund different cross contract calls. Gas price is calculated and fixed per block, but may change from block to block depending on how full / busy the block is. If blocks become more than half full then gas price increases.\n\nWe're also considering adding a max gas price limit.\n\n## Transactions\n\n### How do we follow Tx status?\n\nSee related [RPC interface for fetching transaction status here](/api/rpc/setup#transaction-status).\n\n### How are transactions constructed and signed?\n\nTransactions are a collection of related data that is composed and cryptographically signed by the sender using their private key. The related public key is part of```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This code snippet is actually part of a Markdown document that provides an overview of various topics related to the NEAR Protocol, focusing on transaction finality, account management, fees, and transaction processing. Let’s break down the key sections of this snippet to understand the concepts being discussed.\n\n### Finality in NEAR Protocol\n\n#### Extra Slashing Conditions\n- **Extra Slashing Conditions**: The text mentions that the protocol introduces additional slashing conditions. Slashing is a penalty mechanism in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) systems where validators lose a portion of their staked tokens for misbehavior (e.g., double-signing). This ensures that once a block is finalized, it is nearly impossible to create a competing fork unless a significant portion of the validators (stake) is penalized.\n\n#### On-Chain Transaction Finality\n- **Deterministic Finality**: In NEAR, finality is determined based on a combination of block confirmations and validator signatures. Specifically, a block is considered finalized when:\n  - At least **3 blocks** are built on top of it.\n  - It receives signatures from more than **two-thirds of the current validator** set (i.e., at least (2/3 + 1) signatures).\n  \n- **Quorum Pre-commit**: A quorum pre-commit means that a sufficient number of validators have agreed on the state of the block, which is verified by the finality gadget (a critical component in ensuring that blocks are finalized correctly).\n\n- **Block Depth Requirement**: To further secure the finality of a transaction, it is advised to wait for at least **120 additional blocks** (approximately 2-3 minutes) after a block of interest. This extra time is necessary to handle potential invalid state transitions and allows for challenges on state changes to be processed.\n\n### Account Management\n\n#### Address Generation\n- Accounts in NEAR are generated based on a specification found in the linked document. Each account can represent users or smart contracts.\n\n#### Balance Record-Keeping Model\n- NEAR utilizes an **Account-based model** where each user or contract is linked to a specific account. Each account is stored on a single shard, and it can contain multiple key pairs for transaction signing.\n\n#### Account Representation\n- Users create accounts with human-readable names (like `alice`), which can hold multiple keys with different permissions. This allows for flexible control over the account's actions, including programmable permissions through smart contracts.\n\n#### Minimum Account Balance\n- To prevent \"dust\" (small amounts that are uneconomical to use), accounts must maintain a minimum balance that covers the cost of storing data on the blockchain. If an account's balance drops below this threshold, it cannot store additional data until enough funds are available.\n\n### Keys and Balance Look-ups\n\n#### Number of Keys\n- An account can hold an unlimited number of keys as long as sufficient tokens are available to cover their storage costs.\n\n#### Balance Look-ups\n- NEAR provides an RPC method to view account balances, enabling users to query either the latest state or the finalized state of their account. For security, it’s recommended to only rely on finalized states.\n\n### Fee Structure\n\n#### Gas-Based Model\n- NEAR operates on a **gas-based transaction fee model**, where fees are dynamically adjusted based on network congestion. Each transaction consumes gas, and the user must attach sufficient gas to ensure their transaction is processed.\n\n#### Gas Price Calculation\n- Users can refer to the documentation for guidance on estimating the amount of gas to attach to transactions. The gas price can fluctuate depending on the network load.\n\n### Transaction Processing\n\n#### Transaction Status and Construction\n- Transactions in NEAR are constructed as collections of data that are cryptographically signed by the sender using their private key. This ensures the authenticity and integrity of the transaction. Users can check transaction statuses through provided RPC interfaces.\n\n### Summary\nThis document extracts critical information about the NEAR Protocol's transaction finality, account management, fee structure, and transaction processing. It emphasizes the importance of security, efficiency, and the mechanisms in place to ensure that interactions with the blockchain are reliable and predictable."}]}

This could be useful for managing different wallet versions and guiding users towards using updated versions.\n\n#### `MeteorWalletState`\n\n```typescript\nexport interface MeteorWalletState {\n  wallet: MeteorWalletSdk;\n  keyStore: keyStores.BrowserLocalStorageKeyStore;\n}\n```\n\n- This interface describes the state of the Meteor Wallet.\n- **Properties**:\n  - **`wallet: MeteorWalletSdk;`**: \n    - This property holds an instance of the `MeteorWallet` (renamed as `MeteorWalletSdk`). This instance would provide the necessary methods and properties to interact with the wallet functionalities.\n  - **`keyStore: keyStores.BrowserLocalStorageKeyStore;`**:\n    - This property specifies that the key store used for managing wallet keys is a `BrowserLocalStorageKeyStore`. This means that the keys will be stored in the browser's local storage, which is a common practice for web applications to persist data between sessions.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, this code snippet defines two interfaces relevant to the Meteor Wallet within the NEAR ecosystem:\n\n1. `MeteorWalletParams_Injected` is used for optional parameters that can be injected into the wallet, including an icon URL and a deprecation flag.\n2. `MeteorWalletState` represents the current state of the wallet, including the wallet instance and the key management strategy (using browser local storage).\n\nThese interfaces are crucial for ensuring type safety and clarity when working with the Meteor Wallet SDK and NEAR's key management capabilities."}]}

Let's break down the provided code snippet from the NEAR repository, specifically from the `update.rs` file located in the `chain-signatures` contract.\n\n```rust\n// Assuming this is part of a larger function that calculates the amount of storage bytes used\nbytes_used += 128 * std::mem::size_of::<AccountId>() as u128;\n\n// If a configuration is provided, serialize it to JSON and account for its byte size\nif let Some(config) = config {\n    let bytes = serde_json::to_vec(&config).unwrap(); // Convert config to a byte vector\n    bytes_used += bytes.len() as u128; // Add the size of the serialized config\n}\n\n// If a code is provided, account for its byte size\nif let Some(code) = code {\n    bytes_used += code.len() as u128; // Add the size of the code\n}\n\n// Return the total bytes used\nbytes_used\n}\n\n// Function to calculate the required deposit based on bytes used\nfn required_deposit(bytes_used: u128) -> NearToken {\n    env::storage_byte_cost().saturating_mul(bytes_used) // Calculate total deposit required\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Bytes Calculation**:\n    - The first line calculates the storage required for a fixed number of `AccountId` entries. It assumes there are 128 account IDs, and it uses `std::mem::size_of::<AccountId>()` to get the size of a single `AccountId` in bytes. This total is then multiplied by 128 to get the total size for these entries and adds that to `bytes_used`.\n\n2. **Configuration Handling**:\n    - The code checks if `config` is provided (using `if let Some(config) = config`).\n    - If `config` is `Some`, it serializes the `config` to a JSON byte vector using `serde_json::to_vec(&config).unwrap()`. \n        - `unwrap()` is called here, which will panic if serialization fails—this assumes that failure is not expected in normal operation.\n    - The length of the serialized byte vector (`bytes.len()`) is then added to `bytes_used`.\n\n3. **Code Handling**:\n    - Similarly, if `code` is provided, the code checks for its existence and adds its length (number of bytes) to `bytes_used`.\n\n4. **Return Value**:\n    - Finally, the function returns the total accumulated `bytes_used`.\n\n5. **Required Deposit Calculation**:\n    - The `required_deposit` function calculates the amount of NEAR tokens required for storage based on the number of bytes used.\n    - It calls `env::storage_byte_cost()` to get the cost per byte and multiplies it by the total `bytes_used`. The use of `saturating_mul` ensures that if the multiplication overflows, it returns the maximum value of the type instead of panicking.\n\n### Summary:\nThis code snippet is primarily focused on calculating how much storage space is required for certain data structures in a NEAR smart contract and then determining the corresponding deposit needed to cover the storage costs. The handling of the `config` and `code` allows for dynamic adjustments based on the actual data provided, ensuring that the contract can accurately account for its resource needs."}]}

This custom data structure is designed to be used in smart contracts and leverages NEAR's storage mechanisms. Let's break down the various components of the code.\n\n### Drop Implementation\n\n```rust\n<T, H> Drop for IterableSet<T, H>\nwhere\n    T: BorshSerialize + Ord,\n    H: ToKey,\n{\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\n        self.flush()\n    }\n}\n```\n- This implementation of the `Drop` trait ensures that when an instance of `IterableSet` goes out of scope, it will automatically call the `flush()` method. \n- The `T` type must implement `BorshSerialize` (for serialization) and `Ord` (for ordering), while `H` must implement `ToKey` (to generate keys for storage).\n- `flush()` likely handles any finalization or cleanup of storage, ensuring that all changes are persisted before the object is destructed.\n\n### Debug Implementation\n\n```rust\nimpl<T, H> fmt::Debug for IterableSet<T, H>\nwhere\n    T: BorshSerialize + Ord + BorshDeserialize + fmt::Debug,\n    H: ToKey,\n{\n    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter<'_>) -> fmt::Result {\n        f.debug_struct(\"IterableSet\")\n            .field(\"elements\", &self.elements)\n            .field(\"index\", &self.index)\n            .finish()\n    }\n}\n```\n- This implementation allows instances of `IterableSet` to be formatted using the `{:?}` syntax, providing a way to inspect its state during debugging.\n- The `elements` and `index` fields of the `IterableSet` are printed, which represent the internal structure of the set.\n\n### Constructor Methods\n\n```rust\nimpl<T> IterableSet<T, Sha256>\nwhere\n    T: BorshSerialize + Ord,\n{\n    pub fn new<S>(prefix: S) -> Self\n    where\n        S: IntoStorageKey,\n    {\n        Self::with_hasher(prefix)\n    }\n}\n```\n- The `new` method initializes a new `IterableSet` using a given prefix. This prefix is intended to be unique for the keys associated with the set, preventing collisions with other data.\n- It uses `with_hasher` to initialize the set with a default hashing algorithm (`Sha256`).\n\n```rust\nimpl<T, H> IterableSet<T, H>\nwhere\n    T: BorshSerialize + Ord,\n    H: ToKey,\n{\n    pub fn with_hasher<S>(prefix: S) -> Self\n    where\n        S: IntoStorageKey,\n    {\n        let mut vec_key = prefix.into_storage_key();\n        let map_key = [vec_key.as_slice(), b\"m\"].concat();\n        vec_key.push(b'v');\n        Self { elements: Vector::new(vec_key), index: LookupMap::with_hasher(map_key) }\n    }\n}\n```\n- The `with_hasher` method allows for creating an `IterableSet` with a specified hashing algorithm.\n- It constructs storage keys for the set's elements and the index (a lookup map) using the provided prefix.\n\n### Basic Methods\n\n```rust\npub fn len(&self) -> u32 {\n    self.elements.len()\n}\n\npub fn is_empty(&self) -> bool {\n    self.elements.is_empty()\n}\n\npub fn clear(&mut self)\nwhere\n    T: BorshDeserialize + Clone,\n{\n    for e in self.elements.drain(..) {\n        self.index.set(e, None);\n    }\n}\n```\n- These methods provide basic functionalities:\n  - `len()` returns the number of elements in the set.\n  - `is_empty()` checks if the set is empty.\n  - `clear()` removes all elements from the set and cleans up the index.\n\n### Set Operations\n\n```rust\npub fn difference<'a>(&'a self, other: &'a IterableSet<T, H>) -> Difference<'a, T, H>\nwhere\n    T: BorshDeserialize,\n{\n    Difference::new(self, other)\n}\n```\n- The `difference` method computes the values that are in `self` but not in `other`, returning a `Difference` iterator.\n- This allows for set operations to be easily performed, enabling functionalities like finding unique elements.\n\n### Summary\n\nOverall, this code snippet defines an `IterableSet` data structure that supports efficient storage and retrieval of unique elements, along with operations like determining the difference between sets. The use of traits like `BorshSerialize`, `Ord`, and `ToKey` ensures that the types used within the set are compatible with NEAR's storage and serialization mechanisms. The inclusion of debugging capabilities and various utility methods makes this a robust choice for developers working within the NEAR Protocol ecosystem."}]}

It's checked during `ActionReceipt` execution.\n\n`ActionReceipt` doesn't need to be validated before we start executing it.\nThe actions in the `ActionReceipt` are executed in given order.\nEach action has to check for the validity before execution.\n\nSince `CreateAccount` gives permissions to perform actions on the new account, like it's your account, we introduce temporary variable `actor_id`.\nAt the beginning of the execution `actor_id` is set to the value of `predecessor_id`. \n\nValidation rules for actions:\n- `CreateAccount`\n  - check the account `receiver_id` doesn't exist\n- `DeployContract`, `Stake`, `AddKey`, `DeleteKey`\n  - check the account `receiver_id` exists\n  - check `actor_id` equals to `receiver_id`\n- `FunctionCall`, `Transfer`\n  - check the account `receiver_id` exists\n\nWhen `CreateAccount` completes, the `actor_id` changes to `receiver_id`.\nNOTE: When we implement `DeleteAccount` action, its completion will change `actor_id` back to `predecessor_id`.\n\nOnce validated, each action might still do some additional checks, e.g. `FunctionCall` might check that the code exists and `method_name` is valid.\n\n### `DataReceipt` generation rules\n\nIf `ActionReceipt` doesn't have `output_data_id` and `output_receiver_id`, then `DataReceipt` is not generated.\nOtherwise, `DataReceipt` depends on the last action of `ActionReceipt`. There are 4 different outcomes:\n\n1. Last action is invalid, failed or the execution stopped on some previous action.\n    - `DataReceipt` is generated\n    - `data_id` is set to the value of `output_data_id` from the `ActionReceipt`\n    - `success` is set to `false`\n    - `data` is set to `null`\n2. Last action is valid and finished successfully, but it's not a `FunctionCall`. Or a `FunctionCall`, that returned no value.\n    - `DataReceipt` is generated\n    - `data_id` is set to the value of `output_data_id` from the `ActionReceipt`\n    - `success` is set to `true`\n    - `data` is set to `null`\n3. Last action is `FunctionCall`, and the result of the execution is some value.\n    - `DataReceipt` is generated\n    - `data_id` is set to the value of `output_data_id` from the `ActionReceipt`\n    - `success` is set to `true`\n    - `data` is set to the bytes of the returned value\n4. Last action is `FunctionCall`, and the result of the execution is a promise ID\n    - `DataReceipt` is NOT generated, because we don't have the value for the execution.\n    - Instead we should modify the `ActionReceipt` generated for the returned promise ID.\n    - In this receipt the `output_data_id` should be set to the `output_data_id` of the action receipt that we just finished executed.\n    - `output_receiver_id` is set the same way as `output_data_id` described above.\n\n#### Example for the case #4\n\nA user called contract `a.app`, which called `b.app` and expect a callback to `a.app`. So `a.app` generated 2 receipts:\nTowards `b.app`:\n```\n...\n\"receiver_id\": \"b.app\",\n...\n\"output_data_id\": \"data_a\",\n\"output_receiver_id\": \"a.app\",\n\n\"input_data_id\": [],\n...\n```\nTowards itself:\n```\n...\n\"receiver_id\": \"a.app\",\n...\n\"output_data_id\": \"null\",\n\"output_receiver_id\": \"null\",\n\n\"input_data_id\": [\"data_a\"],\n...\n```\n\nNow let's say `b.app` doesn't actually do the work, but it's just a middleman that charges some fees before redirecting the work to the actual contract `c.app`.\nIn this case `b.app` creates a new promise by calling `c.app` and returns it instead of data.\nThis triggers the case #4, so it doesn't generate the data receipt yet, instead it creates an action receipt which would```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The provided code snippet outlines the transaction processing and action execution workflow in the NEAR Protocol. Here's a breakdown of its key components and logic:\n\n### Key Elements of the Code Snippet\n\n1. **Transaction Validation:**\n   - **`signed_id` and `public_key`:** Each transaction must be signed with the account's private key, ensuring that the sender has the authority to initiate the transaction.\n   - **Access Key Validation:**\n     - The transaction's nonce is verified to prevent replay attacks.\n     - The current price of gas is fetched to calculate the total cost of the transaction.\n     - The total required balance is computed, which includes action fees, deposits, and prepaid gas.\n     - The account's balance must be greater than this required balance.\n     - Each action's permissions must align with the access key; for instance, if the access key allows only function calls, then the transaction's receiver and method must be validated.\n\n2. **Action Receipt Execution:**\n   - Actions are bundled into an `ActionReceipt`, but their permissions and order are validated only during execution, not prior.\n   - Actions within the `ActionReceipt` are executed in the specified order, and each action must perform its own validity checks before execution.\n\n3. **Temporary Actor ID:**\n   - When creating an account, a temporary variable `actor_id` is used to manage permissions. Initially, it is set to `predecessor_id` (the account that initiated the transaction).\n   - Upon successful execution of `CreateAccount`, `actor_id` changes to `receiver_id`, allowing the new account to perform actions.\n\n4. **Action Validation Rules:**\n   - **`CreateAccount`:** Validates that the `receiver_id` does not already exist.\n   - **`DeployContract`, `Stake`, `AddKey`, `DeleteKey`:** Ensures that the `receiver_id` exists and that `actor_id` matches `receiver_id`.\n   - **`FunctionCall`, `Transfer`:** Checks if the `receiver_id` exists.\n\n5. **Data Receipt Generation Rules:**\n   - If an `ActionReceipt` has no `output_data_id` or `output_receiver_id`, no `DataReceipt` is generated.\n   - The generation of a `DataReceipt` depends on the outcome of the last action in the `ActionReceipt`. There are four possible outcomes:\n     1. **Invalid or Failed Action:** Generates a `DataReceipt` with `success` set to `false`.\n     2. **Successful Non-FunctionCall Action:** Generates a `DataReceipt` with `success` set to `true` and `data` set to `null`.\n     3. **Successful FunctionCall with Value:** Generates a `DataReceipt` with `success` set to `true`, including the returned data.\n     4. **FunctionCall Returning a Promise ID:** No `DataReceipt` is generated immediately; instead, the `ActionReceipt` for the promise is modified to reference the previous `ActionReceipt`.\n\n### Example Explanation (Case #4)\n\nIn the context of the fourth case:\n- When a user calls a contract (`a.app`), which in turn calls another contract (`b.app`), the expectation is a callback to the original contract (`a.app`).\n- If `b.app` simply passes the call to yet another contract (`c.app`) without returning data, it creates a promise and does not generate a `DataReceipt` immediately.\n- Instead, it creates an `ActionReceipt` for the promise, linking it back to the original `ActionReceipt` for reference.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis code snippet illustrates the intricate process of how NEAR handles transaction validation, action execution, and receipt generation.

Below, I'll break down the code into its components and explain its functionality in detail.\n\n### Overview\n\nThe code tests various functionalities related to byte storage, panic scenarios, and encoding/decoding between UTF-8 and Uint8Array formats. It uses `t.context.accounts` to retrieve the accounts needed for interacting with the smart contract, `bytesContract`.\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n1. **Storage Read Bytes Tests**\n\n   ```javascript\n   test(\"Storage read bytes tests\", async (t) => {\n     const { ali, bytesContract } = t.context.accounts;\n\n     await ali.call(bytesContract, \"storage_write_bytes\", \"\");\n     let r = await bytesContract.viewRaw(\"storage_read_ascii_bytes\", \"\");\n     console.log(r);\n     t.deepEqual(r.result, [100, 101, 102]); // Expecting ASCII bytes for 'def'\n\n     r = await bytesContract.viewRaw(\n       \"storage_read_arbitrary_bytes_key_utf8_sequence_bytes_value\",\n       \"\"\n     );\n     t.deepEqual(r.result, [0xe6, 0xb0, 0xb4]); // Expecting UTF-8 representation of a character\n\n     r = await bytesContract.viewRaw(\n       \"storage_read_utf8_sequence_bytes_key_arbitrary_bytes_value\",\n       \"\"\n     );\n     t.deepEqual(r.result, [0x00, \"a\".charCodeAt(0), \"b\".charCodeAt(0)]); // Expecting bytes for 'a' and 'b'\n   });\n   ```\n\n   - This test checks the correctness of byte storage and retrieval from the smart contract.\n   - It first writes bytes to storage and then reads them back using various functions (`storage_read_ascii_bytes`, `storage_read_arbitrary_bytes_key_utf8_sequence_bytes_value`, and `storage_read_utf8_sequence_bytes_key_arbitrary_bytes_value`).\n   - The `t.deepEqual` assertions verify that the returned byte arrays match the expected values.\n\n2. **Panic Tests**\n\n   ```javascript\n   test(\"panic tests\", async (t) => {\n     const { ali, bytesContract } = t.context.accounts;\n\n     let r = await ali.callRaw(bytesContract, \"panic_test\", \"\");\n     t.assert(\n       r.result.receipts_outcome[0].outcome.status.Failure.ActionError.kind.FunctionCallError.ExecutionError.match(\n         /Smart contract panicked:*/\n       )\n     );\n\n     // Additional panic tests for different scenarios\n     r = await ali.callRaw(bytesContract, \"panic_ascii_test\", \"\");\n     t.assert(\n       r.result.receipts_outcome[0].outcome.status.Failure.ActionError.kind.FunctionCallError.ExecutionError.match(\n         /Smart contract panicked: abc*/\n       )\n     );\n\n     // Additional tests for various panic conditions\n     r = await ali.callRaw(bytesContract, \"panic_js_number\", \"\");\n     t.assert(\n       r.result.receipts_outcome[0].outcome.status.Failure.ActionError.kind.FunctionCallError.ExecutionError.match(\n         /Smart contract panicked: 356*/\n       )\n     );\n\n     // Other panic tests...\n   });\n   ```\n\n   - This section tests various scenarios that should cause the smart contract to panic. \n   - The `callRaw` method invokes the contract methods, and the results are checked to see if they match expected panic messages using regular expressions.\n   - Each panic scenario is intended to validate the contract's error handling and ensure it returns the expected failure messages.\n\n3. **UTF-8 and Uint8Array Conversion Tests**\n\n   ```javascript\n   test(\"utf8 string can be convert to Uint8Array correctly\", async (t) => {\n     const { bob, bytesContract } = t.context.accounts;\n\n     let res = await bob.callRaw(\n       bytesContract,\n       \"utf8_string_to_uint8array_tests\",\n       \"\"\n     );\n     t.is(res.result.status.SuccessValue, \"\"); // Expecting success without specific value\n   });\n\n   test(\"valid utf8 sequence can be convert to string correctly\", async (t) => {\n     const { bob, bytesContract } = t.context.accounts;\n\n     let res = await bob.callRaw(\n       bytesContract,\n       \"uint8array_to_utf8_string_tests\",\n       \"\"\n     );\n     t.is(res.result.status.SuccessValue, \"\"); // Expecting success without specific value\n   });\n\n   test(\"latin1 sequence can be convert to string correctly\", async (t) => {\n     const { bob, bytesContract } = t.context.accounts;\n\n     let res = await bob.callRaw(\n       bytesContract,\n       \"uint8array_to_latin1_string_tests\",\n       \"\"\n     );\n     t.is(res.result.status.SuccessValue, \"\"); // Expecting success without specific value\n   });\n   ```\n\n   - These tests ensure that strings can be properly converted to and from `Uint8Array` formats.\n   - They check that the smart contract methods handle UTF-8 and Latin-1 sequences correctly, confirming the integrity of data conversion.\n   - The assertions (`t.is`) check that the operations complete successfully.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis code snippet effectively tests various aspects of a NEAR smart contract related to byte storage and UTF-8 encoding. It covers writing and reading bytes, handling panic scenarios gracefully, and ensuring proper conversions between strings and byte formats. The use of deep equality checks and regular expressions helps verify the expected behavior of the contract under different conditions, enhancing reliability and correctness in handling byte data."}]}

We'll get into that in the coming chapters when we'll want to have a prize sent to the first person to solve the puzzle.\n\n## Run the React app\n\nLet's run our frontend on testnet! We won't add any new concepts at this point in the chapter, but note that the [near examples](https://github.com/near-examples) typically create an account for you automatically with a NodeJS command. We covered the important pattern of creating a subaccount and deploying the smart contract to it, so let's stick with that pattern as we start up our frontend.\n\nGo into the directory containing the Rust smart contract and build it:\n\n```bash\ncd contract\n\n# Build\ncargo near build\n```\n\nCreate fresh account if you wish, which is good practice:\n\n<Tabs groupId=\"cli-tabs\">\n  <TabItem value=\"short\" label=\"Short\">\n  \n  ```bash\n  # Delete an account\n  near delete-account crossword.friend.testnet friend.testnet --networkId testnet\n  \n  # Create an account again\n  near create-account crossword.friend.testnet --use-account friend.testnet --initial-balance 1 --network-id testnet\n  ```\n  </TabItem>\n\n  <TabItem value=\"full\" label=\"Full\">\n  \n  ```bash\n  # Delete an account\n  near account delete-account crossword.friend.testnet beneficiary friend.testnet network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send\n\n  # Create an account again\n  near account create-account fund-myself crossword.friend.testnet '1 NEAR' autogenerate-new-keypair save-to-keychain sign-as friend.testnet network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send\n  ```\n  </TabItem>\n</Tabs>\n\nDeploy the contract:\n\n```bash\ncargo near deploy crossword.friend.testnet with-init-call new json-args '{\"solution\": \"69c2feb084439956193f4c21936025f14a5a5a78979d67ae34762e18a7206a0f\"}' prepaid-gas '100.0 Tgas' attached-deposit '0 NEAR' network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send\n```\n\nReturn to the project root and start the React app:\n\n```bash\ncd ..\nenv CONTRACT_NAME=crossword.friend.testnet npm run start\n```\n\nThe last line sends the environment variable `CONTRACT_NAME` into the NodeJS script. This is picked up in the `config.js` file that's used to set up the contract account and network configuration:\n\n<Github language=\"js\" start=\"1\" end=\"2\" url=\"https://github.com/near-examples/crossword-tutorial-chapter-1/blob/3e497b4815600b8382614f76c781252071```"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's break down the provided code snippet and explanation from the NEAR repository related to a crossword puzzle application built with React.\n\n### Code Explanation\n\n1. **State Initialization**:\n   ```js\n   const [solutionFound, setSolutionFound] = useState(false);\n   ```\n   - This line uses the React Hook `useState` to create a state variable `solutionFound` that indicates whether the crossword puzzle has been successfully completed or not. \n   - Initially, `solutionFound` is set to `false`, meaning the puzzle is not completed at the start.\n   - The `setSolutionFound` function can be called to update `solutionFound` later, typically when the user enters the final letter of the crossword puzzle.\n\n2. **Event Handling**:\n   - The text mentions two functions, `onCrosswordComplete` and `checkSolution`, which are responsible for handling events related to the crossword completion.\n   - These functions will hash the user's input (the completed crossword solution) and compare it to a hash value fetched from the smart contract. This ensures that the user's solution matches the one stored on the blockchain.\n\n3. **Rendering JSX**:\n   ```html\n   <h3>Status: { solutionFound }</h3>\n   ```\n   - This line renders a heading that displays the current status of the puzzle. It dynamically updates to reflect whether the solution has been found or not.\n   - If `solutionFound` is `true`, it might display \"Status: true\" or a success message; otherwise, it would show \"Status: false\".\n\n### Utility Functions\n\n- **`parseSolutionSeedPhrase`**:\n   - This function is intended to organize the answers from the completed crossword puzzle correctly. It orders the answers first by number and ensures that \"across\" answers come before \"down\" answers.\n\n- **`viewMethodOnContract`**:\n   - This utility function makes view-only calls to the smart contract to retrieve data, particularly the solution hash that the user’s input will be compared against.\n   - The code snippet mentions that while the API might not be user-friendly, it serves its purpose for fetching necessary data.\n\n### Deployment and Running the React App\n\nThe latter portion of the text outlines the steps for deploying the smart contract and running the React application:\n\n1. **Building the Contract**:\n   ```bash\n   cd contract\n   cargo near build\n   ```\n   - This command navigates to the directory containing the Rust smart contract and builds it using the NEAR CLI.\n\n2. **Creating and Deleting Accounts**:\n   - The commands provided allow for managing accounts on the NEAR testnet, which is useful for testing purposes.\n\n3. **Deploying the Contract**:\n   ```bash\n   cargo near deploy crossword.friend.testnet with-init-call new json-args '{\"solution\": \"69c2feb084439956193f4c21936025f14a5a5a78979d67ae34762e18a7206a0f\"}' prepaid-gas '100.0 Tgas' attached-deposit '0 NEAR' network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send\n   ```\n   - This command deploys the smart contract to the specified account (`crossword.friend.testnet`) with an initial call to set the solution.\n   - The `json-args` parameter contains the solution hash that the user input will be validated against.\n\n4. **Starting the React App**:\n   ```bash\n   cd ..\n   env CONTRACT_NAME=crossword.friend.testnet npm run start\n   ```\n   - This command starts the React application and passes the `CONTRACT_NAME` environment variable, which is essential for connecting the frontend to the backend smart contract.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis snippet illustrates how to set up a simple frontend for a crossword puzzle dApp on the NEAR Protocol using React. The explanation provides insight into state management, event handling, and the interaction between the React frontend and the NEAR smart contract, emphasizing best practices for building decentralized applications.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain the following code snippet from NEAR repository file `neps/nep-0509.md`:\n``` itself is not included here.\npub struct ChunkStateTransition {\n    /// The block that contains the chunk; this identifies which part of the\n    /// state transition we're talking about.\n    pub block_hash: CryptoHash,\n    /// The partial state before the state transition.

It is a list of Merkle tree nodes.\n    pub base_state: PartialState,\n    /// The expected final state root after applying the state transition.\n    pub post_state_root: CryptoHash,\n}\n```\n\nFine, but where do we take the receipts?\n\nReceipts are internal messages, resulting from transaction execution, sent between shards, and **by default** they are not signed by anyone.\n\nHowever, each receipt is an execution outcome of some transaction or other parent receipt, executed in some previous chunk.\nFor every chunk, we conveniently store `prev_outgoing_receipts_root` which is a Merkle hash of all receipts sent to other shards resulting by execution of this chunk. So, for every receipt, there is a proof of its generation in some parent chunk. If there are no missing chunk, then it's enough to consider chunks from previous block.\n\nSo we add another field:   \n\n```rust\n    /// Non-strict superset of the receipts that must be applied, along with\n    /// information that allows these receipts to be verifiable against the \n    /// blockchain history.\n    pub source_receipt_proofs: HashMap<ChunkHash, ReceiptProof>,\n```\n\nWhat about missing chunks though?\n\nUnfortunately, production and inclusion of any chunk **cannot be guaranteed**:\n\n* chunk producer may go offline;\n* chunk validators may not generate 2/3 endorsements;\n* block producer may not receive enough information to include chunk.\n\nLet's handle this case as well. \nFirst, each chunk producer needs not just to prove main state transition, but also all state transitions for latest missing chunks:\n\n```rust\n    /// For each missing chunk after the last new chunk of the shard, we need\n    /// to carry out an implicit state transition. This is technically needed\n    /// to handle validator rewards distribution. This list contains one for each\n    /// such chunk, in forward chronological order.\n    ///\n    /// After these are applied as well, we should arrive at the pre-state-root\n    /// of the chunk that this witness is for.\n    pub implicit_transitions: Vec<ChunkStateTransition>,\n```\n\nThen, while our shard was missing chunks, other shards could still produce chunks, which could generate receipts targeting our shards. So, we need to extend `source_receipt_proofs`. \nField structure doesn't change, but we need to carefully pick range of set of source chunks, so different subsets will cover all source receipts without intersection.\n\nLet's say B2 is the block that contains the last new chunk of shard S before chunk which state transition we execute, and B1 is the block that contains the last new chunk of shard S before B2. \nThen, we will define set of blocks B as the contiguous subsequence of blocks B1 (EXCLUSIVE) to B2 (inclusive) in this chunk's chain (i.e. the linear chain that this chunk's parent block is on). Lastly, source chunks are all chunks included in blocks from B.\n  \nThe last caveat is **new** transactions introduced by chunk with `chunk_header`. As chunk header introduces `tx_root` for them, we need to check validity of this field as well.\nIf we don't do it, malicious chunk producer can include invalid transaction, and if it gets its chunk endorsed, nodes which track the shard must either accept invalid transaction or refuse to process chunk, but the latter means that shard will get stuck.\n\nTo validate new `tx_root`, we also need Merkle partial state to validate sender' balances, access keys, nonces, etc., which leads to two last fields to be added:\n  \n```rust\n    pub new_transactions: Vec<SignedTransaction>,\n    pub new_transactions_validation_state: PartialState,\n```\n\nThe logic to produce `ChunkStateWitness` is [here](https://github.com/near/nearcore/blob/b8f08d9ded5b7cbae9d73883785902b76e4626fc/chain/client/src/stateless_validation/state_witness_producer.rs#L79). \nItself, it requires some minor changes to the logic of applying chunks, related to generating `ChunkStateTransition::base_state`.\nIt is controlled by [this line](https://github.com/near/nearcore/blob/dc03a34101f77a17210873c4b5be28ef23443864/chain/chain/src/runtime/mod.rs#L977), which causes all nodes read during applying chunk to be put inside `TrieRecorder`.\nAfter applying chunk, its contents are saved to ````"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The provided code snippet is part of a data structure used in the NEAR Protocol to manage the state transitions of chunks in a blockchain. Here, I'll break down the key components of the `ChunkStateTransition` struct and the subsequent logic regarding receipts and state transitions, as well as the implications of handling missing chunks.\n\n### Breakdown of the `ChunkStateTransition` Struct\n\n```rust\npub struct ChunkStateTransition {\n    /// The block that contains the chunk; this identifies which part of the\n    /// state transition we're talking about.\n    pub block_hash: CryptoHash,\n    \n    /// The partial state before the state transition. This includes whatever\n    /// initial state that is necessary to compute the state transition for this\n    /// chunk. It is a list of Merkle tree nodes.\n    pub base_state: PartialState,\n    \n    /// The expected final state root after applying the state transition.\n    pub post_state_root: CryptoHash,\n}\n```\n\n1. **`block_hash`**: This field identifies the specific block that contains the chunk. The `CryptoHash` type represents a hash of the block, which is used to verify integrity and ensure the correct block is referenced.\n\n2. **`base_state`**: This field holds the initial state required to compute the transition for this chunk. It is represented as a `PartialState`, which consists of Merkle tree nodes that enable efficient verification of the state.\n\n3. **`post_state_root`**: This field represents the expected root hash of the state after the transition has been applied. It is crucial for validating the outcome of the state transition.\n\n### Handling Receipts\n\nIn the NEAR Protocol, receipts are internal messages that result from executing transactions. They play a critical role in communication between shards. The receipts are not signed by default, but they can be traced back to their origins through a Merkle proof.\n\n#### New Field: `source_receipt_proofs`\n\n```rust\npub source_receipt_proofs: HashMap<ChunkHash, ReceiptProof>,\n```\n\n- This field is a non-strict superset of receipts that must be applied. It includes proof that allows these receipts to be verified against the blockchain history. The `HashMap` associates each `ChunkHash` with its corresponding `ReceiptProof`.\n\n### Handling Missing Chunks\n\nThe NEAR Protocol acknowledges that the production and inclusion of chunks cannot be guaranteed due to various issues (e.g., offline producers, lack of endorsements). To deal with missing chunks, additional mechanisms are required.\n\n#### New Field: `implicit_transitions`\n\n```rust\npub implicit_transitions: Vec<ChunkStateTransition>,\n```\n\n- This vector holds state transitions for missing chunks that need to be accounted for. Each entry represents an implicit state transition required to handle validator rewards distribution. The transitions are maintained in chronological order.\n\n### Receipt Generation During Missing Chunks\n\nWhile chunks may be missing, other shards can still produce chunks that generate receipts targeting the missing shard. The protocol must determine which source chunks cover all source receipts without overlap.\n\n### Validating New Transactions\n\nWhen a chunk is processed, it may introduce new transactions. To ensure these transactions are valid, the protocol needs to validate the `tx_root` from the chunk header. This validation requires access to the Merkle partial state to check the sender's balances and other necessary parameters.\n\n#### New Fields for Transaction Management\n\n```rust\npub new_transactions: Vec<SignedTransaction>,\npub new_transactions_validation_state: PartialState,\n```\n\n- **`new_transactions`**: This vector holds the signed transactions that are introduced in the current chunk.\n- **`new_transactions_validation_state`**: This field contains the partial state needed to validate the new transactions, ensuring that they do not violate any rules (e.g., sufficient balance, valid nonce).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe `ChunkStateTransition` struct and the additional fields discussed are essential for managing state transitions in the NEAR Protocol, particularly in scenarios where chunks may be missing or new transactions are introduced. The design ensures that all necessary checks and validations are in place to maintain the integrity and security of the blockchain, enabling smooth operation across shards. \n\nFor further details, the logic for producing `ChunkStateWitness` is implemented in the NEAR core repository, which dictates how these state transitions and validations are managed in practice."}]}

Let's break it down and explain each section in detail:\n\n### Code Snippet Breakdown\n\n1. **Reference Policy Violation:**\n   ```markdown\n   is technically a violation of the \"`reference` setting wins\" policy described above.\n   ```\n   This line indicates that a specific implementation or aspect of the NFT standard does not adhere to a predefined policy regarding how references (likely to metadata or attributes) should be prioritized within the context of the token standard. The \"reference setting wins\" policy suggests that if multiple references exist, a particular one should be chosen over others based on specific criteria.\n\n2. **Future Possibilities:**\n   ```markdown\n   ## Future possibilities\n\n   - Detailed conventions that may be enforced for versions.\n   - A fleshed out schema for what the `reference` object should contain.\n   ```\n   This section outlines potential future enhancements to the NFT standard. It suggests that more detailed guidelines may be developed regarding how different versions of the NFT standard should be structured and what specific information should be included in the `reference` object. The `reference` object typically holds metadata about the token, such as its creator, attributes, or other relevant data.\n\n3. **Errata:**\n   ```markdown\n   ## Errata\n\n   * **2022-02-03**: updated `Token` struct field names. `id` was changed to `token_id`. This is to be consistent with current implementations of the standard and the rust SDK docs.\n   ```\n   The errata section documents changes or corrections made to the standard. In this case, it notes that the field name `id` has been changed to `token_id` to maintain consistency with both the standard's implementations and the Rust Software Development Kit (SDK) documentation. This change enhances clarity and reduces confusion for developers working with the NFT standard.\n\n4. **Field Type Clarification:**\n   ```markdown\n   The first version (`1.0.0`) had confusing language regarding the fields:\n   - `issued_at`\n   - `expires_at`\n   - `starts_at`\n   - `updated_at`\n\n   It gave those fields the type `string|null` but it was unclear whether it should be a Unix epoch in milliseconds or [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html). Upon having to revisit this, it was determined to be the most efficient to use epoch milliseconds as it would reduce the computation on the smart contract and can be derived trivially from the block timestamp.\n   ```\n   This portion addresses a previous ambiguity in the documentation concerning certain timestamp fields related to the token's lifecycle. The fields listed (`issued_at`, `expires_at`, `starts_at`, `updated_at`) were initially described as `string|null`, which created confusion about their expected format.\n\n   The documentation clarifies that these timestamps should be in Unix epoch format (milliseconds since January 1, 1970) rather than ISO 8601 format. Using epoch milliseconds is preferred because:\n   - It simplifies calculations and comparisons within the smart contract.\n   - It can easily be obtained from the blockchain's block timestamp, ensuring consistency and efficiency in processing.\n\n### Summary\nOverall, this excerpt highlights important aspects of the NEAR NFT standard's evolution, including:\n- The need for adherence to established policies.\n- Future improvement areas for clarity and usability.\n- Corrections made to field names for consistency and developer experience.\n- Clarification on timestamp formats to enhance efficiency in smart contract operations.\n\nThis documentation is crucial for developers working with NEAR's NFT standards, as it helps ensure they implement the tokens correctly and understand the rationale behind certain choices in the standard."}]}

The goal is to replace occurrences of `Self` with a specified type while keeping track of where those occurrences were found. This is useful in generating a clean interface for smart contracts, ensuring they use the correct types in the generated code.\n\nLet's break down the key components of the code:\n\n### Key Functions and Structs\n\n1. **_sanitize_self**:\n   - This is a recursive function that traverses a given type representation (in the form of `TokenStream2`), replacing occurrences of `Self` with another specified type.\n   - It collects the spans (locations in the source code) of all occurrences of `Self` for later reference.\n   - The function handles two main cases:\n     - If the token is an identifier and matches `Self`, it replaces it with the `replace_with` type.\n     - If the token is a group (i.e., a collection of tokens), it recursively processes the inner stream.\n\n   ```rust\n   fn _sanitize_self(typ: TokenStream2, replace_with: &TokenStream2) -> (TokenStream2, Vec<Span>) {\n       let mut self_occurrences = vec![];\n       let trees = typ.into_iter().map(|t| match t {\n           TokenTree::Ident(ident) if ident == \"Self\" => {\n               self_occurrences.push(ident.span());\n               replace_with\n                   .clone()\n                   .into_iter()\n                   .map(|mut t| {\n                       t.set_span(ident.span());\n                       t\n                   })\n                   .collect::<TokenStream2>()\n           }\n           TokenTree::Group(group) => {\n               let (stream, self_occurrences_inner) = _sanitize_self(group.stream(), replace_with);\n               self_occurrences.extend(self_occurrences_inner);\n               TokenTree::Group(Group::new(group.delimiter(), stream)).into()\n           }\n           rest => rest.into(),\n       });\n       (trees.collect(), self_occurrences)\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **sanitize_self**:\n   - This function is the public interface for sanitizing a type. It takes a reference to a `Type` and a `TokenStream2` representing the type to replace `Self`.\n   - It calls `_sanitize_self` to perform the actual replacement and checks for parsing errors.\n   - On success, it returns a `SanitizeSelfResult` struct containing the sanitized type and the spans of the `Self` occurrences.\n\n   ```rust\n   pub fn sanitize_self(typ: &Type, replace_with: &TokenStream2) -> syn::Result<SanitizeSelfResult> {\n       let (ty_tokens, self_occurrences) = _sanitize_self(quote! { #typ }, replace_with);\n\n       let ty = syn::parse2(ty_tokens).map_err(|original| {\n           syn::Error::new(original.span(), \"`Self` sanitization failed. Please report this as a bug.\")\n       })?;\n\n       Ok(SanitizeSelfResult { ty, self_occurrences })\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **SanitizeSelfResult**:\n   - This struct holds the result of the sanitization process, including the new type and a list of spans where `Self` was found.\n\n   ```rust\n   pub struct SanitizeSelfResult {\n       pub ty: Type,\n       pub self_occurrences: Vec<Span>,\n   }\n   ```\n\n### Tests\n\nThe module includes several unit tests that validate the functionality of the `sanitize_self` function. These tests cover various cases, including:\n\n- Direct replacement of `Self` with a specified type.\n- Replacement of `Self` nested within collections (e.g., `Vec<Self>`).\n- Validation of the count of occurrences of `Self` in complex types.\n\n```rust\n#[cfg(test)]\nmod tests {\n    use super::*;\n\n    #[test]\n    fn sanitize_self_works() {\n        // Tests various cases of replacing `Self` with `MyType`\n    }\n\n    #[test]\n    fn sanitize_self_keeps_track_of_replacements() {\n        // Tests that the function correctly counts occurrences of `Self`\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, this code snippet provides functionality to sanitize the use of `Self` in Rust types by replacing it with another specified type while tracking where `Self` was found. This is essential for maintaining a clear and correct contract interface in the context of NEAR Protocol development, helping developers avoid potential pitfalls with type references in their smart contracts."}]}

Here, it is an empty object, meaning no global variables are being defined for this specific configuration.\n\n```typescript\n  transform: {\n    \"^.+\\\\.[tj]s$\": [\n      \"ts-jest\",\n      {\n        tsconfig: \"<rootDir>/tsconfig.spec.json\",\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n```\n- The `transform` property specifies how to process files before testing. In this case, it uses `ts-jest`, which is a TypeScript preprocessor for Jest. The regular expression `^.+\\\\.[tj]s$` matches any file with a `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, or `.jsx` extension. \n- The `tsconfig` option points to a specific TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.spec.json`) that will be used during the transformation. This allows for different TypeScript settings for testing purposes compared to production code.\n\n```typescript\n  moduleFileExtensions: [\"ts\", \"tsx\", \"js\", \"jsx\"],\n```\n- The `moduleFileExtensions` property specifies the file extensions Jest will look for when resolving modules. This configuration tells Jest to recognize TypeScript files (`.ts`, `.tsx`) along with JavaScript files (`.js`, `.jsx`).\n\n```typescript\n  coverageDirectory: \"../../coverage/packages/ramper-wallet\",\n};\n```\n- Finally, the `coverageDirectory` property designates where to output code coverage reports for the tests run within this package. The reports will be saved in a `coverage/packages/ramper-wallet` directory, located two levels up in the directory structure.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, this Jest configuration file sets up testing for the `ramper-wallet` package, specifying how to handle TypeScript files, where to find global settings, and where to output coverage reports. It leverages a shared Jest preset to maintain consistency across different packages in the repository."}]}

It is part of the NEAR contract standards, specifically for handling fungible tokens and their transfer calls. Let's break down the code and explain each component in detail.\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n```typescript\nimport { AccountId, PromiseOrValue } from \"near-sdk-js\";\n```\n- **Imports**: This line imports `AccountId` and `PromiseOrValue` types from the `near-sdk-js` library. \n  - `AccountId` is typically a string representation of a NEAR account (essentially an address).\n  - `PromiseOrValue` is a utility type that allows for a return type that can either be a direct value or a promise that resolves to that value.\n\n```typescript\nexport interface FungibleTokenReceiver {\n```\n- **Interface Declaration**: This declares an interface named `FungibleTokenReceiver`. Interfaces in TypeScript are used to define the structure of an object, which in this case represents a contract that can receive fungible tokens.\n\n```typescript\n    /**\n     * Called by fungible token contract after `ft_transfer_call` was initiated by\n     * `sender_id` of the given `amount` with the transfer message given in `msg` field.\n     * The `amount` of tokens were already transferred to this contract account and ready to be used.\n     *\n     * The method must return the amount of tokens that are *not* used/accepted by this contract from the transferred\n     * amount. Examples:\n     * - The transferred amount was `500`, the contract completely takes it and must return `0`.\n     * - The transferred amount was `500`, but this transfer call only needs `450` for the action passed in the `msg`\n     *   field, then the method must return `50`.\n     * - The transferred amount was `500`, but the action in `msg` field has expired and the transfer must be\n     *   cancelled. The method must return `500` or panic.\n     *\n     * Arguments:\n     * @param sender_id - the account ID that initiated the transfer.\n     * @param amount - the amount of tokens that were transferred to this account in a decimal string representation.\n     * @param msg - a string message that was passed with this transfer call.\n     *\n     * @returns the amount of unused tokens that should be returned to sender, in a decimal string representation.\n     */\n```\n- **Documentation Comment**: This block provides detailed documentation about the method `ft_on_transfer`, including its purpose, expected behavior, and parameters. \n  - It explains that this method is invoked by a fungible token contract after a `ft_transfer_call`, which is a function that allows tokens to be transferred along with a message.\n  - The method is responsible for returning the amount of tokens that the contract does not accept (i.e., unused tokens).\n\n```typescript\n    ft_on_transfer({ sender_id, amount, msg }: {\n        sender_id: AccountId;\n        amount: number;\n        msg: String;\n    }): PromiseOrValue<number>;\n```\n- **Method Declaration**: This line declares the `ft_on_transfer` method that the interface requires.\n  - **Parameters**:\n    - `sender_id`: The account ID of the user who initiated the transfer.\n    - `amount`: The total amount of tokens transferred, represented as a number.\n    - `msg`: A string message accompanying the transfer, typically containing additional data or instructions regarding the transfer.\n  - **Return Type**: The method returns a `PromiseOrValue<number>`, indicating that it will return either a number directly or a promise that resolves to a number. This number represents the amount of unused tokens that should be returned to the sender, also in a decimal string representation.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe `FungibleTokenReceiver` interface is crucial for implementing smart contracts that wish to receive fungible tokens on the NEAR Protocol. The `ft_on_transfer` method allows the contract to handle incoming token transfers while being able to specify how many tokens it will accept and how many should be returned to the sender. This provides flexibility in token management within decentralized applications (dApps) on NEAR. The examples provided in the comments clarify the expected behavior for different scenarios, which is essential for developers implementing this interface."}]}

The tests validate the behavior of the `TreeMap` during insertions and deletions, ensuring that it maintains the AVL tree properties (i.e., balance) and matches the behavior of a standard `BTreeMap`. Let's break down the key components of the code:\n\n### Key Functions and Tests\n\n1. **Test Functions:**\n    - **`test_balance_regression_1` and `test_balance_regression_2`:**\n      These test cases validate that the AVL tree remains balanced after a series of insertions and deletions. They invoke the `avl` function which performs the operations, and then check the balance using `is_balanced`.\n\n    - **`prop_avl_vs_rb`:**\n      This property-based test compares the AVL Tree (`TreeMap`) with Rust's standard `BTreeMap` to ensure they produce the same results after a series of insertions and deletions. It uses QuickCheck for randomized testing.\n\n    - **`prop_avl_balance` and `prop_avl_height`:**\n      These tests verify that the AVL Tree remains balanced and that its height does not exceed a certain limit after operations. They also use QuickCheck for randomized input.\n\n2. **Helper Functions:**\n    - **`avl`:**\n      This function initializes a new `TreeMap`, performs insertions and deletions based on the provided slices, and returns the final state of the `TreeMap`. It uses the `Default` trait for values, allowing for easy initialization.\n\n    - **`rb`:**\n      Similar to the `avl` function, but it creates a standard `BTreeMap` instead. This is used for comparison in the `prop_avl_vs_rb` test.\n\n    - **`is_balanced`:**\n      This recursive function checks if the AVL tree is balanced by ensuring that the balance factor (difference in height between left and right subtrees) for each node is within the range of -1 to 1.\n\n### Code Walkthrough\n\nHere's a brief walkthrough of the relevant functions and their purpose:\n\n```rust\nfn avl<K, V>(insert: &[(K, V)], remove: &[K]) -> TreeMap<K, V>\nwhere\n    K: Ord + Clone + BorshSerialize + BorshDeserialize,\n    V: Default + BorshSerialize + BorshDeserialize,\n{\n    test_env::setup_free(); // Set up the test environment\n    let mut map: TreeMap<K, V> = TreeMap::new(next_trie_id()); // Create a new TreeMap instance\n    \n    // Insert default values for each key in the remove list\n    for k in remove {\n        map.insert(k, &Default::default());\n    }\n    \n    // Process the combined length of insert and remove\n    let n = insert.len().max(remove.len());\n    for i in 0..n {\n        if i < remove.len() {\n            map.remove(&remove[i]); // Remove keys from the map\n        }\n        if i < insert.len() {\n            let (k, v) = &insert[i];\n            map.insert(k, v); // Insert new key-value pairs\n        }\n    }\n    map // Return the resulting TreeMap\n}\n```\n\n### Testing for Balance\n\nThe function `is_balanced` checks the balance of the AVL tree:\n\n```rust\nfn is_balanced<K, V>(map: &TreeMap<K, V>, root: u64) -> bool\nwhere\n    K: std::fmt::Debug + Ord + Clone + BorshSerialize + BorshDeserialize,\n    V: std::fmt::Debug + BorshSerialize + BorshDeserialize,\n{\n    let node = map.node(root).unwrap(); // Get the node by its ID\n    let balance = map.get_balance(&node); // Fetch the balance factor\n\n    // Check if the node is balanced and recursively check its children\n    (-1..=1).contains(&balance)\n        && node.lft.map(|id| is_balanced(map, id)).unwrap_or(true)\n        && node.rgt.map(|id| is_balanced(map, id)).unwrap_or(true)\n}\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis code snippet is crucial for ensuring that the `TreeMap` implementation adheres to AVL tree properties, which are essential for maintaining efficient operations in a balanced tree structure. The use of property-based testing with QuickCheck helps to uncover edge cases and ensure robustness. The comments and structure of the code provide a clear understanding of the intended functionality and the relationships between different parts of the implementation."}]}

Below, I will break down the key sections of the code for clarity and understanding.\n\n### Key Sections Explained\n\n1. **Updating State with Balance**:\n   ```javascript\n   State.update({ balance: Big(balance).div(Big(10).pow(18)).toFixed(2) });\n   ```\n   - This line updates the component's state with the user's balance. \n   - `Big(balance)` converts the balance to a Big number for precision, especially important in blockchain applications where balances can be large.\n   - It divides the balance by `10^18` to convert from wei (the smallest unit of Ether) to Ether, and formats it to two decimal places using `toFixed(2)`.\n\n2. **Fetching Staked Balance**:\n   ```javascript\n   if (state.stakedBalance === undefined && state.sender) {\n       getStakedBalance(state.sender).then((stakedBalance) => {\n           State.update({ stakedBalance });\n       });\n   }\n   ```\n   - This code checks if the staked balance is undefined and if there is a current sender (user).\n   - If both conditions are met, it calls the `getStakedBalance` function to retrieve the staked balance for the sender and updates the state.\n\n3. **Calculating Transaction Cost**:\n   ```javascript\n   if (state.txCost === undefined) {\n       const gasEstimate = ethers.BigNumber.from(1875000);\n       const gasPrice = ethers.BigNumber.from(1500000000);\n       const gasCostInWei = gasEstimate.mul(gasPrice);\n       const gasCostInEth = ethers.utils.formatEther(gasCostInWei);\n       ...\n   }\n   ```\n   - This part calculates the transaction cost based on a fixed gas estimate and gas price.\n   - It multiplies the gas estimate by the gas price to get the cost in wei and converts it to Ether.\n   - The transaction cost in USD is fetched from a GraphQL endpoint that provides the current ETH price.\n\n4. **Fetching CSS Styles**:\n   ```javascript\n   const cssFont = fetch(\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Manrope:wght@200;300;400;500;600;700;800\").body;\n   const css = fetch(\"https://pluminite.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/Qmboz8aoSvVXLeP5pZbRtNKtDD3kX5D9DEnfMn2ZGSJWtP\").body;\n   ```\n   - The code fetches font styles from Google Fonts and additional CSS from an IPFS address.\n   - It checks if the CSS was successfully fetched before attempting to use it.\n\n5. **Defining the Theme**:\n   ```javascript\n   if (!state.theme) {\n       State.update({\n           theme: styled.div`\n               font-family: Manrope, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Segoe UI, Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, Fira Sans, Droid Sans, Helvetica Neue, sans-serif;\n               ${cssFont}\n               ${css}\n           `,\n       });\n   }\n   ```\n   - If the theme is not already defined, it sets the theme using styled-components.\n   - This includes specifying a font family and adding the fetched CSS styles.\n\n6. **Rendering the UI**:\n   ```javascript\n   return (\n       <Theme>\n           <div className=\"LidoContainer\">\n               ...\n           </div>\n       </Theme>\n   );\n   ```\n   - The component returns a JSX structure that represents the UI for staking Ether.\n   - It includes various divs for headers, available balance, and user interaction elements.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis code snippet is part of a decentralized application (dApp) where users can stake Ether and receive stETH in return. It includes fetching and updating user balances, calculating transaction costs, and dynamically applying styling to the UI. The code effectively utilizes promises for asynchronous operations and manages component state to reflect real-time changes in user balances and UI elements. \n\nThis approach adheres to best practices in React and blockchain development, providing a clear and functional component for the user interaction around staking on the Lido platform."}]}

Base58 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme commonly used in blockchain applications to represent byte arrays in a human-readable format. The code utilizes the `bs58` library for these operations.\n\nHere’s a detailed breakdown of each function:\n\n### `baseEncode` Function\n\n```typescript\nexport function baseEncode(value: Uint8Array | string): string {\n    // Check if the input value is a string\n    if (typeof value === \"string\") {\n        // Initialize an empty array to hold byte values\n        const bytes = [];\n        // Convert each character in the string to its corresponding byte value\n        for (let c = 0; c < value.length; c++) {\n            bytes.push(value.charCodeAt(c)); // Get the character code at index c and push it to the bytes array\n        }\n        // Convert the bytes array to a Uint8Array\n        value = new Uint8Array(bytes);\n    }\n    // Encode the Uint8Array (or string) to a Base58 string and return it\n    return bs58.encode(value);\n}\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\n1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts either a `Uint8Array` or a `string`. It first checks if the input `value` is a string.\n2. **String to Bytes Conversion**: If the input is a string, it converts each character of the string into its corresponding UTF-16 code unit (using `charCodeAt`), and stores these values in an array called `bytes`.\n3. **Creating `Uint8Array`**: After constructing the byte array, it converts this array into a `Uint8Array`.\n4. **Base58 Encoding**: Finally, it encodes the `Uint8Array` using the `bs58.encode` method and returns the Base58 encoded string.\n\n### `baseDecode` Function\n\n```typescript\n/**\n * Decodes a base58 string into a Uint8Array\n * @param value base58 encoded string\n * @returns Uint8Array representing the decoded value\n */\nexport function baseDecode(value: string): Uint8Array {\n    // Decode the Base58 encoded string and convert it to a Uint8Array\n    return new Uint8Array(bs58.decode(value));\n}\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\n1. **Input Parameter**: This function takes a single parameter `value`, which is expected to be a Base58 encoded string.\n2. **Base58 Decoding**: It uses the `bs58.decode` method to decode the Base58 string. This method returns a `Buffer`, which is then converted into a `Uint8Array`.\n3. **Return Value**: The function returns the `Uint8Array` that represents the decoded byte data.\n\n### Summary\n- **Base58 Encoding**: `baseEncode` converts a string or `Uint8Array` into a Base58 encoded string.\n- **Base58 Decoding**: `baseDecode` takes a Base58 encoded string and returns the corresponding `Uint8Array`.\n\nThis encoding and decoding functionality is essential in blockchain applications where data integrity and human readability are crucial, such as when dealing with addresses, keys, or other binary data. The `bs58` library is typically used in the NEAR ecosystem and other blockchain platforms for these purposes."}]}

This can be common practice in web and mobile applications to embed assets directly within the code, allowing for easier access and reducing the need for separate asset files.\n\n### What This Code Represents\n\n1. **Base64 Encoding**: The string is encoded in base64, which is a way of converting binary data (like images) into ASCII string format. This is useful for embedding binary data directly in text-based formats, such as JavaScript or TypeScript files.\n\n2. **Usage Context**: In a file like `icon.ts`, this encoded string is likely being used to represent an icon that is displayed in the mobile wallet application. The application would decode this string back into binary format to render the icon.\n\n### How You Would Decode This in JavaScript/TypeScript\n\nTo utilize this encoded string in your code, you would typically decode it and convert it into a usable format (like a Blob or a Data URL). Here’s how you could do this in JavaScript or TypeScript:\n\n```typescript\n// Assuming the base64 string is stored in a variable\nconst base64Icon = \"as5CR37HtJ+T/x3UHMDYT9Xvqbh...\"; // truncated for brevity\n\n// Function to decode and create an image element\nfunction createImageFromBase64(base64: string): HTMLImageElement {\n    // Create an image element\n    const img = new Image();\n    // Set the source to the base64 string, prefixed with appropriate data type\n    img.src = `data:image/png;base64,${base64}`;\n    return img;\n}\n\n// Usage\nconst iconImage = createImageFromBase64(base64Icon);\ndocument.body.appendChild(iconImage); // Append image to the body or any other element\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **Data Type**: You need to specify the correct data type in the `src` attribute. In the example above, it’s assumed the image is a PNG. Adjust the MIME type accordingly if it’s a different format (e.g., `image/jpeg` for JPEG).\n  \n- **Performance Considerations**: While embedding assets like this can simplify deployment, it may not be the most efficient method for larger images or multiple assets, as it can increase the size of the JavaScript bundle. For larger assets, consider keeping them as separate files and loading them as needed.\n\n- **Security**: Ensure that the base64 data does not contain any harmful scripts or data, especially when dealing with user-generated content.\n\nThis encoding technique is widely used for icons and other small assets in applications, especially mobile apps, to minimize the number of requests needed to load resources."}]}
