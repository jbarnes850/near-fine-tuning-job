## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jbarnes850/near-fine-tuned-model.git
   cd near-fine-tuned-model
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root
   - Add your GitHub and OpenAI API keys:

     ```plaintext
     GITHUB_API_KEY=your_github_api_key
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     ```

## Usage

To use the NEAR Ecosystem Fine-Tuned Model, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have completed the installation steps above.

2. Run the fine-tuning script:

   ```bash
   python fine-tune.py
   ```

   This script will:
   - Fetch data from specified NEAR Protocol repositories and articles
   - Process and refine the data using GPT-4
   - Create a JSONL file with the training data
   - Upload the training file to OpenAI
   - Start a fine-tuning job
   - Monitor the job until completion

3. Once the fine-tuning is complete, you will receive a fine-tuned model ID. You can use this ID to make API requests to your specialized NEAR ecosystem model.

4. To use the fine-tuned model in your applications, use the OpenAI API with the provided model ID:

   ```python
   import openai

   openai.api_key = 'your_api_key'
   response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
       model='your_fine_tuned_model_id',
       messages=[
           {"role": "system", "content": "You are a NEAR Protocol expert."},
           {"role": "user", "content": "Explain NEAR's sharding mechanism."}
       ]
   )
   print(response.choices[0].message['content'])
   ```

## Data Sources

The NEAR Ecosystem Fine-Tuned Model uses a variety of data sources to ensure comprehensive coverage of the NEAR Protocol ecosystem:

1. GitHub Repositories:
   - NEAR Protocol documentation
   - NEAR Economic Protocol (NEPs)
   - NEAR node documentation
   - NEAR core implementation
   - NEAR examples and SDKs
   - NEAR tools and utilities

2. Web Articles:
   - Official NEAR blog posts
   - Technical updates and announcements
   - Ecosystem news and developments

The full list of repositories and articles can be found in the `fine-tune.py` script.

## Fine-Tuning Process

The fine-tuning process consists of several steps:

1. Data Collection:
   - Fetches markdown and code files from specified GitHub repositories
   - Retrieves content from selected web articles

2. Data Processing:
   - Extracts relevant information from the collected data
   - Uses GPT-4 to refine prompts and completions for each data point

3. Training Data Creation:
   - Generates a JSONL file with processed data in the required format for fine-tuning

4. Fine-Tuning:
   - Uploads the training data to OpenAI
   - Initiates a fine-tuning job on the GPT-4o-2024-08-06 model
   - Monitors the progress of the fine-tuning job

5. Model Deployment:
   - Upon successful completion, provides a fine-tuned model ID for use in applications

## Model Hosting

The fine-tuned model is hosted on OpenAI's servers and can be accessed through their API. In the future, we plan to make this model available on Hugging Face for easier access and integration.

To use the hosted model:

1. Obtain the fine-tuned model ID from the script output
2. Use the OpenAI API with this model ID in your applications
3. Follow OpenAI's best practices for API usage and rate limiting

## Contributing

1. Adding new relevant data sources
2. Updating existing data sources
3. Improving the data processing and fine-tuning scripts
4. Suggesting new use cases or applications for the model
5. Reporting issues or bugs
6. Enhancing documentation

To contribute:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
