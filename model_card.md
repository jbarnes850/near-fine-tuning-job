- **Optimized for Code and Content**: Enhanced capabilities for understanding and generating NEAR-specific code snippets and technical explanations.
- **Diverse Data Sources**: Incorporates a wide range of data from GitHub repositories, NEAR Enhancement Proposals (NEPs), official blog posts, technical updates, and community developments.
- **Advanced Data Refinement**: Utilizes advanced data processing techniques for content splitting and prompt generation to improve model performance and relevance.

## Intended Use

### Primary Use Cases

- **Development Assistance**: Aid developers in writing and understanding NEAR smart contracts, SDKs, and tools.
- **Educational Resource**: Serve as a learning tool for those new to NEAR Protocol, providing explanations of core concepts and mechanisms.
- **Technical Support**: Assist in troubleshooting and resolving issues related to NEAR development and deployment.
- **Content Generation**: Help create technical documentation, tutorials, and guides related to the NEAR ecosystem.

### Examples

- **Code Generation**: Generate Rust or AssemblyScript code snippets for NEAR smart contracts.
